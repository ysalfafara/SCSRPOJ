neg,We stayed in the mounting wing for our first night. The room had a nice view. But the room in this wing seemed outdated compared to the Lake wing rooms. Sadly  the shower drain we had in our room wasn't working properly. It was flooding every time we had to use the shower. We had requested to change rooms for our second night. Also  there was an on-going construction in the mountain wing but they weren't noisy or too obstructive.;
pos,The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view  we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view  of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall  it was a  good comfortable stay.;

neg,We booked two suites and one Deluxe Queen. The two suites turned out to be on the opposite ends of the hotel and quite inconvenient for us as a group. The suite we got was in the mountain view. It's spacious and clean but old and lacks furnishings of a suite. It looks empty. If you will book this hotel  choose the Lake wing which has nice rooms and better view.;

pos,The view to the lake was amazing! Great Breakfast Buffet! Kids friendly. Sky Ranch with nice rides for kids of all ages & a zip line etc is walking distance from the hotel (right next to Taal Vista)!
neg,You can hear sounds from your neighbours because the wall doesn't insulate well.
neg," Expected the room to have a view of the lake but apparently, the name Lake Wing was misleading. I had to upgrade to a room that actually had a view of the lake!"
pos,Breakfast is wonderful. The resort has a great viewing deck where you see a breathtaking panoramic view of the Taal lake and volcano.
neg,"There is no hot water in the bathroom. Maybe we should have requested to switch another room but since we only stayed there for one night, we just didn't hustle for the change"
neg,It was a full comfy experience excess for the food service at the lobby & as well in the taza restaurant. The service was too slow & we need to keep on calling the waiter for follow up. The was also a time wherein they forgot to serve 1 order which got my mom frustratedz
neg,"The pool is quite far away if your room is in the lake wing, and the signs to get there are not very clear - in fact, there aren't many around! I happened to cross paths with the manager of Taal Vista Hotel who was very accommodating and helpful as he also pointed out the kids club room - but that too needs improvement as there weren't many things to play with at the time my kids were there"
neg,"this hotel is overrated. for a price of 8500 it's not worth it. it's old. the hallway looks creepy and smells like a hospital, you have to walk very far to reach your room. if price range was around 4000 then, it would be a great deal for money."
pos,I booked the room for my sister celebrating their wedding anniversary. The staff sent them a cake with a greeting which was a very nice gesture.
pos,Staff was super friendly & helpful. Location is perfect.
neg,"The food was not good. I think it is overpriced. I asked for extra bed, charged me 1800 including brkfast but I woke up at 3am bec I was cold. The blanket with the extra bed too thin so I asked for an extra blanket. Noisy people on the upper floor & room beside us."
pos,"I was satisfied with my mom & dad''s room 265, overlooking taal lake??... The view has surprised my dad on his special day????"
neg,No bidet in the bathroom
neg,"Some of the furniture (sofa, bath tub) were a bit dated. Not much vegetarian food options in the breakfast buffet."
pos,"The location was excellent, near reataurants, it had the best view of the lake. I had a very relaxing bath with the hot water and bathtub. Service was excellent."
neg,"Bed was hard for my liking. During breakfast, there was a wide variety of food on the buffet but was disappointed bec food that's supposed to be hot was cold. No brown sugar or splenda alternative for coffee"
neg,I cant extend my stay. I little bit expensive though it's worth the stay.
neg,No night swimming
pos,"We liked the food, all staff were friendly and the room is clean."
neg,The washroom - it's not clean. The bath tub and the floor is dirty.
pos,"Celebrated my birthday here in Taal Vista and it's one of the most memorable! :-) they prepared something for me in my room and gave all the request we asked, the best staff I've seen in a hotel! Will book this hotel for my wedding for sure."
pos,Immense improved faculties since the old Taal Vista Lodge
neg,My visitors at lake view side stayed at premier rooms on the third floor. We went the circuitous way when in fact there is a shorter route via 2nd floor lift. There should be a written instruction to guests regarding this info
neg,No assistance from the staff taking you to your designated room
pos,"Stunning location overlooking the volcano and lake, very good buffets, nice large comfortable rooms, friendly staff. Loved Tagaytay, weather is much cooler than Manila"
pos,"the buffet breakfast was good. our deluxe room is very comfy. an additional single bed was provided without a fee,its definitely a plus for a fa,ily of 2 adults and 2 kids.thank you Taal Vista."
neg,There's no bidet in bathrooms.
neg,They should give the rooms a revamp. The floortiles in our room were loose... Breakfast was plenty but mediocre.
neg,the checkin was a bit slow. but its ok we were greeted warmly and with drinks.
pos,"The place was just perfect & what we needed for a relaxing overnight stay. It was raining the day we checked in, but we had a wonderful sleep, thanks to the in-room massage we had! The weather got better the following day so I woke up to the beautiful site of the Taal Lake and its surroundings. It was just breath-taking! There was a variety of choices for breakfast, and I was even able to request for hot choco! Yum! The walk around the hotel grounds was relaxing and nice, and the shop inside the hotel was convenient (I forgot to bring a shirt, but got one there.). The front desk ladies were pleasant, and all the hotel staff were polite and friendly wherever you meet them. It was a great experience overall! Would stay again! :)"
pos,"I like the most are the staffs, they are very courteous and respond to our queries immediately. It offers good & tasty breakfast. Also, it has a great view of Taal Lake. The hotel is huge, very clean and their check-in and check-out services is fast."
neg,Toilet bowl had water stain ring
neg,Poor coordination.
neg,They didn't accommodate my request prior to my stay from Sunday to Wednesday.
neg,Woke up sweating at 4am bacause of defective airconditioning only to be transfered to another non-cooling aircon room. 2 room transfers in 1 day 
neg,i think its a bit xpensive for 9500 per night since we do not even have balcony and bathtub in our room.
neg,"Coffee was cold. Called the customer/room service literally 6 times! Nothing happened! Our request didn't arrived. So we decided to personally go to the lobby and ask. Wasted 2 1/2 hours waiting for nothing. We were supposed to surprise our mom coz it was her birthday, because of this, surprise was ruined. Very disappointing ...??????????"
neg,"Upon check in, the staff is ignorant about senior citizen discount. ..we persisted and eventually got it."
pos,"The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view, we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall, it was a good comfortable stay."
pos,"We enjoyed ourselves during our stay. The view is magnificent. Our room is so-so. It can be dusted a little more like the top of the pictures, lamp shade, bathroom amenity tray, etc. My husband and I are a bit more critical than most guest being he was in the hospitality business for decades. The bathroom is ok. The grounds are clean and have a dedicated area for smokers. Parking is available for a fee unless it's validated. Our room was #464 which only has a courtyard view. We'd stay there again."
neg,Not enough restaurants within walking distance. Hotel taxi to airport or bus station not free.
neg,Wifi is weak
neg,Poor explanation regarding pre-authorization payments.
pos,"The hotel is beautifully situated for the best views of the phenomenal vistas of the craters and lakes so iconic of Tagaytay. The restaurants serve great drinks, snacks and sandwiches though we did not eat a meal in the hotel. We stayed in a lovely large suite in the older wing of the hotel. The ensuite bathrooms are small and a little dated but the rooms are comfortable and the beds are great. The spa at the hotel was excellent as well. "
neg,Room was dated. Bed was uncomfortable.
pos,"We stayed at the Lake Wing and we had a nice view of the Taal Lake and the SkyRanch from our veranda. The rooms were big, clean, spacious. The view from the veranda was very relaxing and we enjoyed it so much. The hotel is PWD friendly. The staff were helpful. The restaurant serves good breakfast although not many choices. Overall, we had a very relaxing and enjoyable family bonding at this Hotel."
neg,The service at the coffee shop at night when my wife and I stayed there to order drinks.
pos,"It was an awesome trip for us since one of us came from Mindanao (Me and my other friend from Cebu) and we just met in Manila for that short vacay. Good decision we moved here from our initial booking at The Lake Hotel since the latter was under renovation during our travel. Taas Vista was easy to find and staff were accommodating. We only stayed a few minutes at the lobby to complete the check in process. Reaching our room, while my friends took a rest after our long travel, I stayed at the terrace as the view was alluring. From there, you will have the best sight of the lake and like 45 degree view of the Sky Ranch. In terms of food, they offer a variety for breakfast at their buffet stations."
pos,"we stayed in the lake wing of the hotel. we originally booked a deluxe room but got an upgrade upon check in. the room was clean, bathroom was spacious, and the view of Taal lake from the veranda was very relaxing. staff were very courteous and helpful."
neg,The room didn't have bathtub and the room looks outdated. We stated at the lake view room with balcony. 
pos,Very good breakfast
neg,We stayed in the mounting wing for our first night. The room had a nice view. But the room in this wing seemed outdated compared to the Lake wing rooms. Sadly  the shower drain we had in our room wasn't working properly. It was flooding every time we had to use the shower. We had requested to change rooms for our second night. Also  there was an on-going construction in the mountain wing but they weren't noisy or too obstructive.

neg,Valet parking is with a fee. A bucket of ice (requested for room service) is also with a fee!!!
pos,The 2 BR suite is spacious..bed is big and comfortable. Hotels view of the taal is always an added bunos for the stay. Verandas breakfast option is also good.

pos,comfy bed
neg,We arrived at 2:30 for check in. Were still made to wait for several minutes for them to check if the room is available. The room should be ready by 2PM
pos,The greens surrounding the entire property is very relaxing and soothing to the eyes and the soul. For s busy person like me  communing with nature recharges and invigorates my inner being.
neg,I wish there was a refill for the fruits because we there was still an hour left for the buffet service. Also  the aircon was not so cold.
pos,I like the bed!
neg,My room is too far from the lobby and the dining area  it made me walk too long and far to get to my room. Its a bit hard to get public transpo from the place during non peak hour.
pos,Its very peaceful in the venue. The staff are very accommodating.
neg,A better wifi connection in the entire room  booked a suite room but cannot connect with the wifi in the living room.  They don't cater/allow an extra bed.  Better to have more options on their breakfast menu especially on their dessert station.  The rooms (since we booked three rooms) are not well maintained- the bathtubs have no drain stopper/cover and peeling finish (even in the suite room) and the old wooden doors are damaged especially their edges.
pos,The place was just perfect & what we needed for a relaxing overnight stay.  It was raining the day we checked in  but we had a wonderful sleep  thanks to the in-room massage we had!

pos,The room should have vday in the rest room and other restrooms in the lobby.  Everyrhing went well.
neg,Coffee was cold. Called the customer/room service literally 6 times! Nothing happened! Our request didn't arrived. So we decided to personally go to the lobby and ask. Wasted 2 1/2 hours waiting for nothing. We were supposed to surprise our mom coz it was her birthday  because of this  surprise was ruined. Very disappointing ...
pos,The reception was accommodating!  The view deck and garden was superb! The rooms are great. Had a good night sleep. Feels like home!
neg,Lousy service in restaurant everyday at breakfast! Disinterested and non attentive staff and could not cope with a full house!
pos,The hotel location and grounds and lake view room.  Plus the FO and Spa staff.
neg,The view at our room was the courtyard. Kinda sad and gloomy
pos,Staff were very friendly.  Location was superb  lovely view from the main balcony except from our room.  Live music was good too.
neg,The view from our room was a bit of a let down.  The hallway from the old building needs updating.
pos,Breakfast overload
neg,Upon check in  the staff is ignorant about senior citizen discount. ..we persisted and eventually got it.
pos,The view food and staff.
neg,Some rooms needs to be updated. Bathroom needs to be updated as well.
pos,Room
neg,The breakfast buffet.. the fish was salty
pos,Location  facility
neg,Meal option  no vegetarian or halal menu.  Wifi sometime loss and very slow

pos,Pleasant and relaxing.
neg,Wifi is weak.....
pos,Like the Amenities and the view
neg,Poor explanation regarding pre-authorization payments.
pos,Bed
neg,No bidet and old model of hot and cold shower
pos,Awesome view  bit cold temperature  warm welcome by the hotel  and campfire during dinner.
neg,No bidet
pos,we stayed in the lake wing of the hotel. we originally booked a deluxe room but got an upgrade upon check in. the room was clean  bathroom was spacious  and the view of Taal lake from the veranda was very relaxing. staff were very courteous and helpful.
neg,No desserts (other than fruits) on breakfast  view wasn't as expected (view was the Sky Ranch and highway - room without balcony)  cold floor (tiles)
pos,I lost my purse and the staff were brilliant making sure I got back intact!
neg,food in the restaurant was pricey and the breakfast buffet didn't have a lot of options. nevertheless  if you don't like the food in the hotel  there's a Robinson's mall nearby. you can also eat at Bag of Beans or Mushroom Burger
pos,The staffs are friendly and polite. The rooms at the Lake wing are the best.
neg,The Game room and the things inside it is quite old. I suggest they renovate it  replace the billiard table  buy an original billiard balls  add more dart pins (there is only one). The TV is not working. Add and think of other indoor activities/recreation. :)
pos,Clean facilities. Nice coffee (nespresso) in the room. Helpful staff. Great breakfast. 'Appreciate the variety and attention to details (vegetables cut  etc.)
neg,Gym facilities could be improved.
neg,Booking.com price doesn't include hotel taxes  and I think its in a fine print  so felt a bit annoyed about the increased costs when we reached the hotel and got to know about the costs
pos,Most of the things except pricing
neg,From the time I made a booking  I requested for a quiet room. But when we already entered  our room it was very noisy  I think that there are renovation being done near our room. So I called the attention of the front desk and she immediately transferred us.
pos,I really liked their grilled pork & beef it's very juicy. Actually we really loved all the foods.
neg,While breakfast offer many choices  it's fair to say that it's not as tasty as i thought View of the room is not the best
pos,Great location and view. Just next to sky ranch Easy to find since there is a lot of sign
neg,The service at the coffee shop at night when my wife and I stayed there to order drinks.
pos,I like the warmth of your staff especially Ericka at the friont desk.  The front office manager was so friendly and accommodating!
neg,They have poor customer service. I went there because I wanted to enjoy since it was my birthday but unfortunately most of the staff I encountered were snob and not easy to approach. The desk officer also told me I will be given a complimentary item which will be served directly in the room since its my birthday but nothing came.
pos,The breakfast buffet was great though  we all enjoyed it
neg,We don't like the view from our room.
pos,We appreciate the kid's club though there's not much in there. My kids love the pool as well.
neg,What I don't like is our room is not located at Ta-al lake view. The bathroom door is hard to pull and the water from shower room over flow outside the shower door.
pos,I like the view of Ta-al lake.
neg,The room didn't have bathtub and the room looks outdated. We stated at the lake view room with balcony.
pos,The location is amazing! The room size is huge. The staff are awesome.
neg,The service at the restaurant  room service  and IT.
pos,The cleanliness of the place.
pos,View
neg,Mini-bar was empty.  No bath may or hand towels in bathroom
pos,The view!
neg,No bidet or toilet sprinkler.
pos,Premier room at the lake wing is big and has a nice view of the Taal lake. Quiet. Clean.
neg,The aircon in the room that we've stayed in   room 352   has a leak which causes the floor to be wet and slippery  it even wet my clothes that I left on the side chair  aircon seems old and takes time to cool the entire room.
pos,The location   ambiance and buffet breakfast.
neg,The weather. When we went there it was raining
pos,Over looking
neg,Our room was a bit far and we needed help during  check out but nobody came so we had to carry all our stuff with our baby. Plus the screen door of our room is brokern.
pos,The room is comfy and nice.
neg,Booked family of six and was separated by the two wings of the hotel (10 minute walk between).
pos,Very family friendly.
neg,the restaurant food is slightly pricey and not so good taste....
pos,the view from my room and friendly front desk  that's all
neg,the comfort room. dirty
pos,just the venue.
neg,I requested a room with  a nice view of the taal lake but the room they gave me was in front of a big tree. All i saw was leaves. And the pool was very far from the new wing  not so convenient if you have a baby with you. I also saw a cockroach in our bathroom. 
pos,Great view
neg,Fridge is not cold and not really clean.
pos,Stunning view. Clean swimming pool and accessible famous spots and restaurants
neg,Property needs upgrade and more options for buffet breakfast
pos,It was the location of the property
neg,The.linens in the bathroom seem to be old.
pos,The client service rep (Kevina)at the counter was very courteous and accommodating.
neg,Bathroom is  a little old in our room
pos,Good breakfast buffet  volcano view from the backyard  nice staff
neg,I think management is doing a poor job maintaining the place. It has deteriorated quite a bit since the last time we stayed there in 2013.
pos,The location was superb.
neg,What i dont like is i call for tray clearance but nobody come to pick up.. I hang the please make my room sign before we go to veranda for breakfast .. When we came back after 4 hours still nobody clean our room or collect the rubbish.. I hope in the future it will be improve the housekeeping service.. We stay there 3 days and 2 nights.. Anayway thanks for the friendly staff and to the management of taal vista hotel..
pos,I like the staff they are very polite.. I like the food in veranda and the staff as well..
neg,I dont liked the beddings its itchy  probably the bugs!
pos,I liked the courtesy of staffs  & the food!
neg,Game room needs a little updating.
pos,Staff was friendly and view was great and breakfast buffet was excellent.
neg,Coffee
pos,Very good breakfast
neg,We stayed in the mounting wing for our first night. The room had a nice view. But the room in this wing seemed outdated compared to the Lake wing rooms. Sadly  the shower drain we had in our room wasn't working properly. It was flooding every time we had to use the shower. We had requested to change rooms for our second night. Also  there was an on-going construction in the mountain wing but they weren't noisy or too obstructive.
pos,The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view  we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view  of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall  it was a  good comfortable stay.
neg,amenities are a little dated
pos,location and view
neg,Check in and check out .. long wait time!
pos,Location location location
neg,some food are not good taste
pos,All the staff that I have encountered were very courteous and helpful. We did enjoyed the variety of the buffet breakfast and the view of taal volcano from the veranda.
neg,I think the rooms could use some updating. Wonderful location and has great amenities. Historically an important landmark of the area. To keep up with the growth in tourism in the area updating of the rooms would be beneficial.  The rooms are still fine  just not as contemporary as the other hotels we stayed in.
pos,Scenic view  food and staff
neg,it's a costly specially when peak season..
pos,garden  clean room  great view to taal view
neg,The cold weather

pos,Breath taking view of the lake. The breakfast buffet selection.
neg,Lack of public transportation.
pos,Great view and staff
neg,We had to wait to be seated for breakfast. They had difficulty in accomodating all guests during breakfast.

neg,Cr has no bidet And aircon was not strong enough to provide adequate room temp
pos,location and food
neg,The room was too far from the lobby and parking
pos,overall ambiance is very relaxing..staffs ang very friendly
neg,Nothing :)
pos,Accomodating staff and friendly guards and location
neg,I paid 1800 for an extra bed and the breakfast buffet but they did not provide the extra bed that i paid for. The price that is posted here in booking.com is 4582.69 but i was charged with 7400 though i am aware of the additional 1800. Booking.com should have informed that prices are subject for change.
pos,Convinient
neg,Premier room has no bidet
pos,The room is big with very nice background.
pos,Great view
pos,All is perfect  location and ambiance  love the sceneries in veranda! Staff are very friendly and courteous  always smiling :)
pos,According to my 3yr old daughter the room is nice and cozy. The breakfast buffet was ok its not as what i have expected for the price.
pos,Ambiance
neg,Comfort room and the towels
pos,The food in the veranda
neg,When we checked-in at 2:40 our room wasn't ready yet. It was kind of disappointing cause we had a child with us so we had to wait until 4:30.
pos,The breakfast was amazing  I guess that's one reason why we keep coming back. I love that all your buffets  food and restaurants are all in to give the best.
neg,Service at the lobby is poor. We waited too long to be served.
pos,Quiet and relaxing place to spend the weekend.
neg,Wall is too thin. You can hear everyone's everything.
pos,It was okay.
neg,The waiters & waitress at the buffet hall don't  smile or greet guests considering that there weren't too many guests having breakfast that time. The buffet selection that day was very limited & wasn't exactly what we expected it to be since we have had great buffet breakfasts here before.
pos,The overall comfort and courteous staff are truly amazing!
neg,Limited channels in cable channel
pos,This hotel is one of the best in this area. Special thanks to Krystelle from Front Desk.
neg,The first room that we booked. I got sick after i ate Breakfast.
pos,The chefs at the buffet hall at the noodles   pastries and omelette stations were the most friendly & most accommodating staff that served us.
pos,Bed was comfy
pos,The rooms are far from the reception  fauset is broken. But the place has a fantastic view from the restaurant..
pos,Didn't like the first room we booked. Dirty and smelly linens  bathroom dirty toilet seats dirty   Floors looked soo old  and dirty. so  we have to upgrade to another more expensive room. But second room was awesome! Food wise ist's alright too expensive for the quality of food and not too much selection.
neg,A few mosquitoes inside the room Lavatory sink hve no drainage plug
pos,Food and facilities
neg,We booked the lake wing coz we want to have the lake view room only to find out that we were given a room without view. Asked for room change but was offered a room upgrade for extra cost. We only stayed there for less than 20 hours. In total we spent almost 8000 php  very expensive for 16 hrs stay only. :(
pos,the live music at the lobby (pianist)
neg,limited selection of food
pos,Since the weather in tgaytay is a bit cold its much better if the pool is heated. The connecting area was far to lake wing area. I cannot find the play area for kids
neg,No assistance going to the room
pos,The food are good and delicious..nice stay..
neg,Playground for kids bec there is a bad smell
pos,The views of the lake
neg,The main restaurant only offers buffet on breakfast and dinner. With pre-teens in my group who don't eat much  it would be nice if they also serve ala carte along with the buffet menu.
pos,View and facilities
neg,Facilities are a bit dated Veranda too small to accommodate everyone for breakfast Mountain wing was quite a walk from the lobby
pos,Nice hotel.
neg,The room we stayed in was quite dated and was clean enough and tidy  but could do with a deep clean in bathroom and wardrobes etc. very little soundproofing between rooms
pos,Convenient location; has a spa; good food choices Bed was very comfortable and smelled very good! Taal suite was just right for a small group meeting/planning session
pos,Great breakfast. Very comfortable bed. Friendly staff.
neg,the staff during breakfast didn't gave my request for a ketchup even though he passed on our table several times. its like nothing happened. it ruined the breakfast a bit!
pos,Good location
neg,The kids play area was boring...lacking in activities to do
pos,The room was spacious and clean...but the view from the window was distracting because of an old small house nestled amongst the trees...the breakfast buffet has a wide variety of food choices...excellent taste
neg,The extra bed is too expensive for the charge It looks like as if you're lying on a hospital bed and too old  not that comfortable at all
pos,Accessibility to sky ranch and also the view
neg,Almost 1 hr delayed check in and the staff at the front desk can't even tell when can we accommodate the room they just keep on telling us that they will check on the housekeeping staff...they told us to wait but can't even tell us how long 
pos,Love the breakfast  they're serving taho which is not common to some hotels!
neg,the bathroom  especially the shower area. I'm not used to taking a shower inside a bath tub. moreso  it compromises your balance when you stand up inside a bathtub. it would be nice if they could change it to a more conventional shower enclosure. thanks and God bless!
pos,Lovely location and views. This is an old property that has charm but needs attention.
neg,Their dinner buffet was a bit pricey...even pricier than buffet101 considering the number of choices were limited...
pos,Suitability of overall Hotel design and ambience.
neg,The bathroom was disappointing  rooms need refurbishment and general service system overhaul. The food at breakfast was limited and again in a country full of fresh fruit I can not understand why the juices are not fresh.
pos,Out room with perfect view seeing Taal Volacano  my parents was very happy
neg,Breakfast and chef in the omelette station. She is not very customer service oriented.
pos,The views were excellent  the gardens were good for light walking - restaurants offered a good choice of food
neg,A liitile issue about the malfunctioning of its door lock
neg,some confusion at check out - three charges incorrectly shown on invoice - Mini-bar not fully stocked on arrival -- all satisfactorily reversed after discussion with reception staff.  Also renovation work in nearby room was disturbing for short periods of time.
neg,location of the pool.
pos,location really.
neg,The sunny side up eggs were not done to perfection.
pos,Good view of the Taal Volcano.  Proximity to entertainment and restaurants.
neg,Ham and bacon test so bad very pork menu here is strange test.
pos,The view from very nice. Bed is very good.
neg,The food served in dinner was costly compared to what we ate outside at balay dako
pos,The complimentary breakfast is delicious and has variety of choices from english to flipino delicacies
neg,NONE
pos,The kids love the place because it has kid's club and a pool..
neg,We booked for a king bed plus a single extra bed for our family stay and were asked to pay for breakfast for our child who just turned 8.  However  it is mentioned in our reservation that breakfast is free.
pos,I LIKE THE AMBIANCE OF THE HOTEL
neg,The doors were difficult to open even after electronic lock is open Towels were old  stiff
pos,Location is great and property is well maintained. Taza restaurant offers fresh and delicious choices.
neg,Pool should have a better view.
pos,Food was excellent!
neg,We didn't like the view from our window at the Lake Wing  the name itself is a misrepresentation.   All we saw from our window was the Skyranch's vast storage area/dumping ground  a messy lake of monoblock chairs.
pos,The breakfast buffet was lovely  and the spa was amazing!
pos,Aside from the view of Taal  we have always liked the breakfast buffet at Cafe Veranda including its new ambiance.  We also noticed that a bidet had been installed in the bathroom and the bathroom itself has more privacy now than during our last stay in 2015.
neg,The price of the breakfast menu...too pricey The kids club should have more activities for the kids
pos,The spacious room and the breakfast buffet
neg,When we check in there are no towels inside the bathroom   before we checkout somebody came ti check the refrigerator but is was empty when we entered the room.
pos,The view of the lake frim the hotelwas great
neg,Hotel could have informed us  that there was a ongoing food convention at our (lakeview) wing. The music started at 6am in the morning and the loud bass literally 'shaked' me out of bed. We would have safed ourselves the overpriced 'upgrade' to the room w/ lakeview (which we thought  we already had booked through booking.com). Which brings me to the next point: room description should include: view to courtyard/view to lake.  One last thing: the lakeview wing is right next to the sky ranch amusement park. It is loud and you can hear people screaming from the rollercoaster. If you are looking for something more quite  ask for the mountain view wing. (No view of the beautiful lake thou) Would still recommend the hotel for families w/ kids and honeymooners. Not so much for travelers on a budget/group of friends wo like adventure (as the is nothing really to do except the volcano hike.)
pos,The view was amazing. The staff very friendly. And the included breakfast offered choices for every taste button.
neg,no daily news paper  no city maps available
pos,accessible to major land mark..
neg,The tiles in the shower area could be cleaner
pos,Breakfast was really superb
neg,The door lock frequently malfunctions making it difficult to open
pos,The feeling of having plenty of space
neg,None
pos,The surrounding
neg,Poor service  it took three calls to have someone come to fix the internet  then it was still slow.
pos,Nice view.
neg,Wifi was diffiucult to access  Espresso bullets were used already  Very dim lights st the receiving area of our room
pos,Our view...
neg,The room is not clean. Even the toilet is dirty and clean well. I think the cleaner not doing their job properly. All is excellent except for the cleanliness of the room. I was so disappointed for the cleanliness.
pos,Great view and well spend money
neg,It wasn't about the property. It is about the cost of pizza we ordered. It was only Php400 in the menu but when we checked out it was about Php500. We found out there was service charge.
pos,We can plug our external hard drive to the TV and watch series/new movies
neg,Quite expensive eg breakfast buffet for 950  should be a bit lesser.
pos,The ambiance is really great  despite its old i highly respect the restoration.
neg,You can hear sounds from your neighbours because the wall doesn't insulate well.
pos,Gorgeous view towards the Taal Lake.
neg,The bathroom is not really clean. Bottled water should automatically be replenished on the 2nd day.Also  we didn't know that they have entrance to the sky ranch  we were not able to use the entrance. Entrance fee should be free  it should be a privilege
pos,The view deck and access to sky ranch. Breakfast is very good  there's ample choices of food.
neg,Pool heater should be provided
pos,The scenery was fantastic  the room was so clean and the staff were courteous.
neg,The breakfast was ordinary.
pos,I just love this hotel  the room is big enough  quiet & the staff our courteous plus the food was great  especially the croissant and the free fresh fruits in the lobby & inside the room...;-)
neg,well since it's summertime  they could have extended the swimming hours until about 7pm since the sun goes down pretty late so the kids can enjoy more swimming time...
pos,Food is great. Peacefully relaxing place to be.
neg,Just a little upgrade on the bathroom at the mountain side building.
pos,Best view and location. Excellent!
pos,All the staff were great and super nice. Our stay was very relaxing. Location is good since it's near everything. Will definitely be back.
neg,Our room view wasn't really good. But everything else was ok.
pos,Food is good. Room was better especially that it has a bathtub than the room I had before.
neg,Expected the room to have a view of the lake but apparently  the name Lake Wing was misleading.  I had to upgrade to a room that actually had a view of the lake!
pos,Best view of Taal.
neg,Few choices for breakfast.
pos,The view though we didn't get the lake view of the room but still my kids enjoyed staying there.
neg,food specially the the ala carte can still be improved.
pos,staff always smiling and very helpful  friendly  courteous and professional
neg,The bathroom has hair strands and plsntake note of this ALL THE STAFF ARE NICE EXCEPT THE STAFF AT THE FRONT DESK THEY ARE NOT FRIENDLY IVE TALK TO THIS OTHER GUEST AND THEY TOLD ME THE SAME
pos,Breakfast is superb
neg,Service extremely poor.  We have waited for our meals about 2 hrs and end up frustrated and left the restaurant.  Worst Valentine Day's dinner ever.
pos,The hotel is quite dated but still a very good one for this area.
neg,Renovation/construction should as much as possible be done when adjoining rooms are vacant.
pos,Price is a bit high  but it was all worth it - considering I booked online 3 minutes before arriving at the hotel. Excellent room  high class facilities. View was superb. Breakfast buffet is great and they serve until 10:30 am. Staff are accomodating and polite.
neg,None.
pos,The view and cool weather
neg,Rooms could use a bit larger airconditioning machine.
neg,Traffic going there
neg,Room service. Ordered coffee as we are checking out very early  it wasn't delivered at all.
pos,The view was superb  the room was spacious  very comfortable  and clean. The staff were all very accommodating and professional.
neg,It is a little confusing to find your room.  And the elevator to access your room is on the 2nd floor  not the ground floor!
pos,The view from the Lake View rooms are breathtaking! Ask for a room on the 4th floor to maximize your view of the lake and volcano.
neg,early morning noise from hotel guests at the viewing area.
pos,Loved the breakfast as there were lots of selection! Tza fresh table is a must try for a romantic dinner  amazing food and service! The view from our room was magnificent - overlooking the lake. Clean - Spacious room and comfortable to stay. All the staff were very accommodating and helpful.
neg,Too crowded @ the reception on weekends
pos,View fantastic - long walk to the central part of hotel for breakfast
neg,Generally  the bathroom in our room could have been cleaner  or better yet renovated. For one  after a hot shower the mirror fogged up and markings I LOVE U by the previous guest (most probably) appeared. Caught me by surprise and scared my a little bit. The floor/tiles looked a bit old and dirty.
pos,The food and service
neg,No bidet in the toilet.
pos,The place was beautiful. Loved the garden with a view of Taal Lake. The room was nice and spacious as well. The hotel staff were accommodating and pleasant.
neg,VEry Poor Wifi connection. EXpensive rate for an old bldg room mountain wing if I remember it right.
pos,Hospitality of your reception desk. And the food.
pos,Very gracious and accommodating staff Nice view of Taal Lake Generous breakfast
pos,Location and the view
neg,Bathroom pipeworks can be improved (rank smell even if the room is supposed to be fresh - just readied for new occupancy). Hotel rooms look very much dated. For the price they are charging per night  they should renovate or update the rooms.
pos,Great breakfast buffet spread
neg,The internet connection is really  very very poor; the food selections should be revisited by the management including its value for money; the location of the room from the main lobby is quite very discomforting; the floor in the room should not be made of tiles because its cold temperature is very very discomforting to the feet especially if you walk barefoot in the floor;  the management should consider installing bidet in the toilet;
pos,The room is spacious and the bed is comfy
neg,Service needs to be improved.
pos,Location  beyond question is really amazing and great.  The view from the room and from the observation deck is really mesmerizing. The staffs are friendly and their services are warmth and heartfelt.
neg,Dinner of Feb.14 2017. It took more than 1-1/2 hour to be served. Maybe because  the  staff are all preoccupied with the number of guest  and  they overlooked our  simple Kare-Kare  and  soup of  the  day. My wife and  I  went up Tagaytay very Hungry and  needs  to  catch up with our booking. But it is forgivable. Do not worry about it.  We  will  still patronise your very nice  hotel in the future.
pos,Breakfast was good. Friendly staff.
neg,the beddings. as if it was not changed when we get there. the smell is not as fresh.
pos,The Hotel Staff are are very polite and accommodating.
neg,the mountain wing is already old. needs to be refurbished
pos,everything except the beddings
neg,Well  after our wedding  we decided to come back and book our suite room again which is still available and at around 11 PM close to midnight they made us wait in the lobby (I was wearing my wedding gown and my groom his tux) just for housekeeping to clean it. such a bummer that nobody cleaned the suite room after we use it after the wedding preps. But it's all good :) they manage to clean the suite room in 30minutes..
pos,i like that it is clean and doesn't smell even if the room looks old.
pos,The great view of Taal Volcano. Nice  friendly and accomodating staff. The hotel has an interesting background and history with pictures and story around the hotel.
pos,The Staff are hospitable and facilities are okay.
pos,The staff and crew are the best attribute this hotel have. 2 thumbs up  I have stayed here for our wedding and they have given us Congratulatory/Welcome gifts and cakes in our room. LOve love Taal Vista!!! It's like my family's second home.
neg,The pool water is cold. No food heater on breakfast.
pos,The romantic dinner set-up. The view of the lake.
neg,Gym is closed on sunday
pos,Food and drinks
neg,>the rooms were very far from the reception area  restaurant and other facilities I was not offered(or maybe I should have requested a room facing the lake) >there was no bidet in the toilet >limited choices for breakfast
pos,View  accomodation and staff
neg,Needs more facilities for kids..
pos,>the family room the I got is very comfortable for family with 4-6 adults and 2-4 kids >very big and spacious >good view of the lake and volcano >very near to malls and skyranch
neg,The service could have been better  especially in the restaurant.
pos,Friendly staff and the proximity to sky ranch
neg,I expected to have rooms facing taal lake.
pos,Location and facilities are amazing. We had a wonderful family room.
neg,rooms are getting dated could do with a face lift  especially the bathroom. Ground floor room but the windows were dirty on the outside?
pos,The staff are great.  You will feel good seeing their good smile at all times including the security personnel. Plus points is the easy access from hotel to SKYRANCH.
neg,I wish the staff told me at check-in I had a choice between the Lake View Wing and the Mountain View Wing  and I wish someone had been honest about the unexciting view from the Mountain View Wing! (Too much to wish for  but still...)
pos,Location is brilliant  staff were very helpful and attentive without being intrusive  Food was of a very high standard and excellently presented which more than compensates for a what some may see as a limited menu.
pos,Taal Vista Hotel is an awesome hotel. The view and location of hotel is perfect. I like that fact that there are securities in the area and in the middle of Tagaytay city.
neg,The toilets have no bidet for hygiene purposes.
pos,The food are delicious and there are many choices.  We didn't get the nice view of the lake due to limited rooms available
neg,None
pos,Good and Variety of food  Friendly staff
neg,the lobby cafe was too small that we did not have any space when we visited the area  after our dinner outside....
pos,view / weather
neg,we weren't able to have our breakfast at veranda because it was full. room keys didn't work properly.
pos,every member of the staff i encountered was courteous and helpful. joyce of veranda went above and beyond when i requested for a cup of bulalo broth to be served in another restaurant.
neg,I think more attraction for kids
pos,Great!!!
neg,Sometimes the heated water was not hot enough
pos,room food view
neg,The elevator near our room/ in our floor broke down on our second day. We have a baby and a stroller so it was a bit of a hassle to use the stairs. Fortunately it was fixed within the day.
pos,I like the location and its near fun ranch
pos,The food and the ambiance
pos,The whole ambience of the hotel was pleasant and the hotel employees are friendly and helpful. The food was okay.
pos,Taal Vista Hotel continues to be the best established hotel in Tagaytay City. Its been there for decades and the service and facilities remain fresh. It also remains to be one of the best located hotel/resorts in town  with the best view along Tagaytay ridge. The rooms are spacious and the staff are extremely friendly. I booked multiple rooms for family who were visiting from the US and all were extremely happy with their accommodation for the weekend! Parking was never a problem  though they do not have valet service.
neg,The cr doesnt have bidette...
pos,The weather
neg,No bidet
pos,Bed very comfortable. Hotel and room very clean. Good view of Taal lake. Friendly and accomodating staff
neg,Food in hotel restaurant and breakfast buffet left us wanting more... No bidet in bathroom  No telephone shower... Overpriced in our opinion
pos,The food is really good. The breakfast buffet was fresh and yumm. Nice view  of course and very comfortable bed as well.
neg,The cup for brushing teeth was dirty though
pos,Breakfast was good and staff are respectful. Overall experience is very good.
neg,Sitting capacity in the resto bar located at the lobby is limited. Food during lunch and dinner is very expensive and not worth the price considering the selections and tastes.
pos,The comfortness of our room and the Veranda's breakfast buffet  aside from the view deck where we have the perfect view of the Taal Lake/Volcano itself.
neg,Checking in took a while  but it was ok.
pos,It was an excellent stay. Will be back soon.
neg,Buffet
pos,Cleanliness and the view from our room!
neg,Internet connection of our room is actually slow..  :'( failed to do some online stuff. It even keeps turning on and off..  I wish for a faster internet connection
pos,Scenery
neg,Drops of water from the aircon. We had to put a catch basin and a towel to avoid any accident.
pos,Cozy bed
neg,- No bidet (minus 1 star ;p) - Room service doesn't provide any tray to eat on. Have to pay extra if you want them to fix a table for you. (what??) - Staff forgot to refill toilet paper. >_< - Buffet is a bit overpriced.
pos,- Very nice view and location - Accommodating Staff - Relaxing lounge - Parking is no problem
neg,Toilet didn't have bidet
pos,Great view of the island volcano
neg,The room provided was quite old already. In the picture it looks very different
pos,good weather... cold
neg,Our room feels old and needed renovation. It feels damp
pos,The view and atmosphere is very relaxing. Being near the Sky ranch added a spectacular view specially at night which the kids enjoyed.
neg,The place needs renovation especially the elevator at the Mountain Wing and the shower room.
pos,The location is just beside the Sky Ranch and just in front of a casino. If you're hungry during the wee hours  then you can always order from McDonald's which is just in front of the hotel.
neg,Restaurant
pos,View
neg,No improvement at all in the game room and gym facilities
pos,greeting us with an anniversary cake. very thoughtful.
pos,Super love the view  food  and the staff. They are very accommodating.
neg,The hallway to the rooms look cold and creepy.Its like you went down to a dungeon or a dugout in the basement . Looks more like  a barracks than a 5 star hotel hallway. All you see is a long stretch of walls and bare floor to match it. No windows or any decors. They could have warmed it up a bit by putting art pieces on the wall or  a consul table every few meters  planters etc.
pos,Its goodlocation
neg,I AM A REGULAR GUEST OF THIS HOTEL THE PROBLEM IS IF IT IS PEAK SEASON THE QUALITY OF SERVICE IS POOR.
pos,Amazing view from our room and staff were very polite and helpful. ATM machines are right at the hotel. It's also just next door to sky ranch  it's actually where the action is. Also   My son had an accident (not a serious one thankfully) and all staff were very attentive. A very special thanks to Glenn for his amazing support. Would come back to this hotel.  Btw  we loved lounging at the bar next to lobby.
neg,Old furnishings
pos,The view of taal volcanoe
neg,Wedding receptions all over  hotel guests and wedding guests mixed together. Receptions should have their own area. A little bit overpriced
pos,Wonderful location and excellent staff.
neg,Check-in took long. Queue management should have been better.
pos,nice location
neg,the room is small  considering we got the premier queen room and compared to the room we got from another big hotel in the area (in previous visit). the toilet/bath room has no bidet  and small. in other words  the room is not value for money.
pos,staff were friendly and the rooms were spacious  renovations were good.
neg,Old towelsI
pos,View was fantastic.  Room was big and clean.
neg,the room had a long distance to walk to.
neg,Balcony is too near each other.
neg,I didnt like the process of your buffet breakfast at the time we are there .And the ways of how are the sitting arrangement when ever we arrive at the buffet resto.And one more we have the experience that we are requesting  more sunny sideup eggs and the cook told us that there are no more eggs anymore is that right?And One more choices of food are not so many and the drinks are also limited.I suggest that you must improve the foods and choices of foods.And Imust suggest that you putr a waiting area near your front desk coz. if many people are checking out or checking in at your hotel we cannot find any near sofa that guests are to comfort themselves.
pos,I like the services of the staff and at bthe concierge people .
neg,Toilet has no exhaust and hose. Internet is slow.
pos,The free breakfast  good AC  and quietness of the place.
neg,An indoor heated pool should have been great.
pos,The hotel location is exactly what I need to get relax with my family. The room is excellent as it is at the 4th floor Lake Wing overlooking perfectly the lake.
pos,Well the staff were friendly and accomodating and as always I love the ambiance of Taal Vista.
neg,There was a delay in me getting my room. Also  the noodle in the breakfast was very soggy.
pos,Location  Weather
neg,The comfort room don't have bidet.
pos,The room was comfy.
neg,I called the operator and housekeeping and there was no answer.
pos,The lake view..
neg,The bath tub where you will Take your shower was flooded once you open the water.
pos,The view. Non alcoholic beverages were free.
neg,For the amount we are paying  we dont even have access to a fridge where we can keep our water cold. Food wasnt so good either. How can you go wrong with bacon in a buffet :( but they did. Also we called for late check out but apparently we pushed the wrong number (4)  so we asked to be transferred to front desk  but the staff said he will take care of it and no need to be transferred. We wanted to make sure so we called  the front desk after 2 hours to verify  only to find it  it wasnt noted down. What if we didnt call to double check? We would have been rushed out or got charged extra. In the end  they were able to let us stay (thank you) but we expected better coordination with their staff.
pos,Location is very near the wedding venue of my niece . But the AC was leaking in our room 213- mountain wing ( didn't know that this was the old wing) . The plug for the percolator was not working even After the staff FIXED it.
pos,Place was well maintained. Staff were helpful.
neg,Too pricey for an ooold hotel that's been renovated countless times! Other newer hotels in the area are catching up and offering better value for your hard earned money.
pos,Really great location  great staff  good facilities  good buffet spread!
neg,Two hours waiting for the room.  The room assigned didn't conform to what I have requested  2- bedroom suite with less view of the lake and more of mountain  not worth for the money I paid.
pos,Location
neg,I booked a Lake View wing room but there was no view of the lake in sight from our room it was the back of Sky ranch and just untrimmed grasses. It was a let down. I was expecting to see the Taal volcano view :( . The building is pretty old as well.
pos,Great location  good customer service  the spa was lovely as well.
pos,nice breakfast buffet
neg,As a regular Booking.com customer  you call me a genius and entitled to certain perks like a late check out. The property did not cooperate.  They insisted on their own policy!
pos,As usual  we liked the venue itself and the comfortable rooms. Service is generally Ok except for one lady at the reception who was not accommodating at all.  I requested for a late checkout because we had a baby with us and she was taking her nap.
neg,The dinner buffet choices
pos,Personalized welcome note from the manager with a basket of fruits and a slice of cake was a sweet gesture.
neg,The long walk from the front desk to our room located at the lake wing
pos,location friendly staff
neg,bed is quite not comfortable
pos,Comfortable and cozy room
neg,2 cockroaches inside the room
pos,Delicious breakfast.
neg,Swimming pool is not heated.
neg,The breakfast wasn't that good ... the coffee was terrible
pos,The bed is comfiortable and the place has excellent location.
neg,The persons talking on the hallway can be heard in the ridgerooms especially when they are noisy. The running of the kids on the hallway can be heard inside the room.
pos,Easy to find location and nice view of Taal
neg,The hallways and corridors leading to the rooms are long and winding  no lighting (at night)  and we needed to go up and down numerous stairs because there are only few elevators which do not serve all floors. Plus the old room interiors do not match the high price.
pos,Everything!
neg,Price using your site was not including tax. The lake wing isn't really the lake view.
pos,good room and bed.
neg,Staff were too slow. had to make several follow up with one thing after the other.
pos,The staff at the bakeshop was very accomodating
neg,Far location of amenities from the room
pos,The view is incredible from the lake wing. The breakfast had amazing variety. The room was big and very comfortable.
neg,The breakfast made my partner sick every morning  I believe they probably do not cater for tourists. Most of the staff were pretty hopeless. The restaurant served my partner raw chicken at lunch!  Housekeeping were very nice but didn't clean rooms well during our stay. The pool closes too early. The games room is old and not looked after  the dart board had 1 dart. I personally wouldn't call this place 5 star.
pos,The view from the premier room of Taal Lake.  Breakfast buffet is never a disappointment. Courteous staff. Housekeeping service is very efficient helpful polite  and always happy to serve
neg,Given the price of the hotel  it is in need of immediate repairs for some of the room facilities like handles  door knobs etc. They're not very top of the line anymore .
pos,The bathroom  the venue and the buffet breakfast
neg,The room  it looks old and some parts already needs repair like the screen at the balcony. They also need to check the foods at the bar  some beverages already has rusts.
pos,There's an extra bed..spacious.. There's a kiddie area.. Staff were soooo accommodating and helpful.
neg,No elevator in Mountain side :(
neg,No bidet in our room.
pos,The room is perfect for family (2 bedroom)  the staffs are all nice and the food is great. I love the hotel itself  its so relaxing.
neg,Nothing
pos,Location  view  fresh air  spa
neg,Softer pillows please.
pos,Nice location and view
neg,The rooms in the Mountain wing are old and not worth the money. Also  it isn't connected to the hotel.
pos,I liked the breakfast and the view. I liked our room in the lake view better than the one in Mountain view.
neg,The bathtub has small cockroaches in them  this is located at the mountain view room and the toilet has a smell.Towels and sheets are not white and old grayish in color. The receptionist did not get back at us for our request of getting a drivers room .
pos,The room is quiet  near the swimming pool  accessible to the main area. The service and food is very good  Errol did a wonderful job to serve us well. Concierge service is great.
neg,Room rates are high
pos,Buffet breakfast & location
neg,None
pos,All good
neg,Wifi connection is bad in mountain wing and room could have been perfect if not for the connecting doors.
pos,Almost perfect.
neg,I'm a regular but this is the first time Ive experienced that the towels have a smokey smell 
neg,too crowded and HUGE... geared to mass family events. Site is enormous so room service takes forever to arrive.
pos,food was OK. Staff very polite and well trained. Views are magnificent. place is very clean.
neg,Our room at the basement
pos,The beef tapa
neg,The hotel is a little bit old. Based on our experience  SOME rooms have broken hot/cold showers  dripping A/Cs  stagnant water in some areas whenever it rains.  UGH! the WI-FI has no signal at the MOUNTAIN WING  while they have weak signal at the the LAKE WING. The presidential suite needs to be renovated. I think they need to renovate ALL the rooms at the mountain wing.  I think they should hire a landscape architect too. They have beautiful trees & plants but it's too unorganized.
pos,Our room (2 bedroom deluxe suite) was spacious and perfect for our family. The hotel grounds are lovely and our 2 year old had a grand time running around. The hotel also has direct access to the Skyranch and this was a huge bonus for us. Since traffic in Tagaytay could be a bummer  it's great that we had a lot of things to do inside the hotel. The food (breakfast buffet and a la carte choices in the Lobby Lounge) was good  too.
neg,They charge 25 usd for early check-in (!!). If the room is ready  why wouldn't we get in without paying additional extras...
pos,My family is regular here. Whenever we go to Tagaytay  we stay at their hotel. We love the view of the Taal Lake from their premises.  The spa has amazing service. I usually complain & bruise a lot from other spa's services BUT NOT here :). My sister & I like Shiela because of her amazing skills in massage. The food from the lobby is great. My family likes to stay there most of the time while drinking coffee/hot choco & eating cake. Great ambience! I love the piano pieces. My parents love the singers. The buffet ...hmmm... it's decent. We just noticed that everytime we go there  the choices of the food is decreasing. We don't know. I must say that they used to have several choices.  The Taza has amazing pizza. Great ambience! great staff too!  Hmmm...did you try the room service? you should! we love it! leche flan turon & mixed veggies <3 <3 <3 AMAZING STAFF SERVICE! ....and I hope it stays that way! Last checked in: Nov. 1  2016
neg,The bedsheet  pillow case  and the towel its too old... looks like a dirty its so untidy and itchy  Pls. Replace it. And their room has no carpet!
pos,The view
neg,bed rates pricy
pos,We like most the breakfast buffet meal  so delicious!
neg,The comfort room. There is no bidet. :/ so hard to wash. Faucets are far. You need to call housekeeping to request a dipper and bucket.
pos,the breathtaking view
neg,Internet reception  poor
pos,i love the location of Lake swing Hotel. The view is so awesome. You can see all view of taal lake and volcano. Also the foods in restaurant taste good. High five for these hotel. Will definitely go back here.
neg,The water in the pool is too cold. I wish Taal Vista will add more pool with warmer water for the oldies...
pos,Friendly staff
pos,The amenities  especially the hotel room
neg,The only downside is the long and winding walk from one building where we stayed to the main building where reception and lobby is. The main restaurant for the buffet breakfast was under renovation. When we stayed there in October 2016
pos,Everything-location  rooms  beds  breakfast  staff. there is free parking and free wifi in the room. We had a welcome plate of fruits and a slice of cake to greet us upon entering the room for the first time. The non alcoholic beverages in the fridge were also complimentary. The bathroom is spacious with complimentary toiletries and bedroom slippers.
neg,Need to work on AC in the hotel and room very hot. You can see that the hotel is aging and renovations are needed and in progress.
pos,Location is great. Staff are accommodating.We'll always come back here!!! We'll be waiting for the reopening of the new veranda overseeing the Taal lake!!!
neg,No bidet in the toilet
pos,Friendly staff especially lobby lounge and security.
neg,Some of the hotel under renovation. Also very big so not so intimate
pos,It was a nice experience the room was clean  the atmosphere was good  and most of all the staff were helful and friendly.
neg,My plan for my girlfriend's birthday somehow(late) didn't went well. They recommend something so I thought it was okay  and I don't have an extra plan due to tight schedule and busy work. Please do not recommend something if it isn't final. I even upgraded my room for a lake view room. Overall it was good but somehow disappointed. Thanks.
pos,Big corner room with beautiful views
neg,Just a bit pricey.
pos,The service were good.
neg,We had difficulty to have late check out while I have genius benefit at the end we got only 1 hr Also watch out room 382 lake wing because there is big tree obscure the view
pos,Breakfast was great but lack the ambiance as it was in a big ballroom. Otherwise its all good.
neg,A bit costly  not so affordable price but its worth it...
pos,The location especially lake wing rooms with balcony
neg,The comfort room doesn't have a bidet. Would be great if it has one.
pos,Love the bedroom and huge barhroom.
pos,The bed is really soft. I like the amenities in the room. The people that assists me are cheerful and patient with my inquiries. Aircon is very easy to operate. The lake view is really breathtaking. It was very nice to wake up and appreciate the site. Too bad I wasn't able to use the gym nor the pool (due to the work I'm doing that day) but there will be a next time.
neg,Your bathroom does not have a bedet  it's hard to clean yourself after taking a dump.
pos,Staff had been lovely and location
neg,The room should be a Lake view and expected it is a lake view but it seems its only the name of the accomodation or building
pos,The bathroom was clean and big. The bed was comfy and the room was larger than I expected. We had a mountain view room and the view was pretty.
neg,Checkout was awful i waited my luggage almost an hour to be picked up from my room to lobby
pos,It's near to sky ranch & restaurants. Relaxing with the veranda view of taal lake
neg,No hose in toilet and breakfast was not great.
pos,Location staff is very well
neg,We booked two suites and one Deluxe Queen. The two suites turned out to be on the opposite ends of the hotel and quite inconvenient for us as a group. The suite we got was in the mountain view. It's spacious and clean but old and lacks furnishings of a suite. It looks empty. If you will book this hotel  choose the Lake wing which has nice rooms and better view.
pos,Room had wonderful view of the lake and bar lounge was lovely
neg,The water from the shower room comes out on the floor going to the bed??i dont know maybe we use the shower very strong???
pos,Location is excellent. Has very nice view of Taal lake. The staff are all courteous and accommodating.
neg,front desk assistance.. too slow
pos,We love the room..all is in there.hair dryer iron for clothes we can boil hot water for coffee...perfectour memories here will  treasure forever
neg,A little bit expensive than other hotels in the area.
pos,excellent breakfast...really enjoyed
pos,Pleasant views.
neg,I'm from USA so I don't drive while vacationing in Phillippines.  There should be a way the staff can assist in getting customers a shuttle  taxi  or some type of transportation to get them to where they need to go.  It just didn't feel pleasant staying in such a beautiful and luxurious hotel  to then after checking out having to carry your luggage down the street to grab transportation.
pos,The hotel is luxurious and beautiful. Located next to kids amusement park. There's also a casino directly across the street. The complimentary breakfast was excellent.
neg,I would expect a shower/bath combo for a deluxe room  maybe this is something they can do in the future as there is ample space to have one. A maisonette bed near the lamp shade might look better than a plain chair.
pos,All of my requests were granted with no questions asked. I loved the complimentary birthday cakes for me and my mom. Excellent service  very nice ambience and relaxing stay. It could have been a bit longer. Thank you!
neg,waiting to check in & check out...
pos,Location
neg,The food at Taza was good and service was commendable. Breakfast buffet staff was a whole lot different. Coffee tastes like water  no cream  no stirrer. You have to ask multiple times before they are able to serve you. But the food is good.
pos,Location is great
neg,The Mountain Ridge rooms are old and outdated. It hasn't been maintained well. Sheets  towels and beddings aren't that great. Overall  it feels as if it isn't part of the hotel compared to the lake wing. Coffee at the breakfast buffet tastes like water.
pos,Peaceful and clean ; Nice view
neg,Once the sliding door of the bathroom is locked from the inside  the person inside cannot open the door. The size of the bathtub anti-slip mat was too wide
pos,The ambiance is relaxing
neg,Bathtub and sink is clogged. Towels are old so I can't dry up. Key card malfunctioned twice and I have to walk far to the info desk. Adjacent room can be heared. Must have a double door to the extension
pos,cleanliness of the entire hotel  staff were so friendly  buffet breakfast was excellent  had a very peaceful and comfortable stay at the room  comfort room was clean and organized
neg,We were informed via email that we were upgraded from premier to suite but when we got there they still booked us in a premier room without explanation that we were not granted with the upgrade. In our room we ask the front desk and that is the time they asked someone what happened. They retracted that perks because that said maintenance did not push thru . The retraction email was only sent after our complaint . Retraction should be timely to prevent frustration and embarrassment from guest
pos,the tomahawk porkchop is really good.. 
neg,nothing....keep up the good work guys...i will refer your hotel to my friends and relatives
neg,The romantic dinner package should have pushed through if there were more choices on the menu.
pos,Loved the coziness and the atmosphere is so relaxing   quiet  peaceful and romantic for us.
neg,All excellent.
pos,Very friendly staff.  Decent breakfast buffet. Lake view rooms have good view of volcano.
neg,The rooms need to be refurbished.
pos,Fantastic view of lake  spacious rooms  beautiful lawns  nice parking and very courteous staff
neg,this hotel is overrated. for a price of 8500 it's not worth it. it's old. the hallway looks creepy and smells like a hospital  you have to walk very far to reach your room. if price range was around 4000 then  it would be a great deal for money.
pos,We like the view  one of the best views of Taal Volcano. The coffee shop is very cozy  and has a good view of the lake.
neg,i booked for a lake view but didnt get it and higher floor but didnt get it.
pos,the staff were really kind and helpful. at first i booked a de luxe room 7500  and very disappointed.very small beds and our view was just a wall. so i requested to upgrade our room to a higher floor with the view of the lake  they were kind enough to do so ofcourse i paid extra but it was a good decision. the lake view room with king size bed was way lot better.
neg,The traffic going there.  Can SM do something?
pos,All requests are granted and everything we need were provided
neg,I wish there was bidet in the toilet.
pos,Less choices for buffet breakfast
pos,The buffet breakfast was delicious and the room clean.
pos,Breakfast is the best!!!!
neg,No BIDET for toilet
pos,Ambiance is good courteous staff. Food is delicious
neg,The pool is quite far away if your room is in the lake wing  and the signs to get there are not very clear - in fact  there aren't many around! I happened to cross paths with the manager of Taal Vista Hotel who was very accommodating and helpful as he also pointed out the kids club room - but that too needs improvement as there weren't many things to play with at the time my kids were there.
pos,The view to the lake was amazing! Great Breakfast Buffet! Kids friendly.  Sky Ranch with nice rides for kids of all ages & a zip line etc is walking distance from the hotel (right next to Taal Vista)!
neg,The design of the bathroom and shower. The air-conditioning of the room goes to the shower area which makes it uncomfortable. also the Toilet when used the scent permeates to the room.
pos,The breakfast buffet ha a good selection of foods. The staff were hospitable and neat looking.
neg,There was a little problem about your comfort room (water closet/reservoir) in our room we accomodated.
pos,My room is ok but my mistake was  i have to get the lake wing next time.
neg,Limited choice of breakfast specially for Muslims people Bathroom is not good
pos,The Leake wives very nice
neg,No door at the bathroom. No bidet.
pos,I love the view and the accomodating staff.
neg,Too expensive
neg,Bit expensive
neg,I hate the bugs and moths on the veranda at night
neg,No senior citizen discount?
neg,none
pos,the buffet breakfast was superb. there were lots of choices and they kept refilling the empty containers
neg,It was a full comfy experience excess for the food service at the lobby & as well in the taza restaurant. The service was too slow & we need to keep on calling the waiter for follow up. The was also a time wherein they forgot to serve 1 order which got my mom frustratedz
pos,Staff are very friendly and helpful. You will be greeted with smiles everytime. View from the premier room is amazing
neg,Did not get the room we wanted due to very very over booked. But that's understandable. 2 requested call backs were not made.
pos,The view
neg,Breakfast buffet is expensive for a so-so taste
pos,The Food and ambiance
neg,Nothing
pos,We enjoyed the view from our room..The traffic was heavy outside so we just had our food served in the room and had  dinner in the balcony..     Food was good.. we have a view of the lake   quiet  it was such a relaxing stay..
neg,Early closing of Pool area and minor defect of sanitary wares
pos,beautiful view from the deck in the evening  Kultur the lobby level shop has a good collection.
neg,old toilets (not even a shower mixer)  not so comfortable beds long walk from the room to the restaurant  one restaurant under renovation  so just one in operation + a lobby level coffee shop  you have to wait long to find your waitress in the restaurant  the ordered beer was served at room temp  they asked me if I would like to add ice:) again but for few fast food chain restaurants  the mall and the other fine dining restaurants are not in walking distance.
pos,The hotel is well maintained The staff are polite and courteous overall it was an hassle free stay
neg,The in-room food menu
pos,We booked two rooms with the lake view (new building) and the scenery was magnificent. Kudos as well to their staff for great customer service.. Although my issue with the room was not entirely fixed  they continuously communicated and kept me updated on what they were doing. I felt like they were very well trained in customer service.
neg,One of the rooms that we booked had a semi-faulty aircon.. They can't fix it  to the point that I asked for an electric fan to be placed in the room.  It helped.. but felt weird that such 9K per night room has a faulty aircon.
neg,There is no hot water in the bathroom. Maybe we should have requested to switch another room but since we only stayed there for one night  we just didn't hustle for the change.
pos,Breakfast is wonderful. The resort has a great viewing deck where you see a breathtaking panoramic view of the Taal lake and volcano.
neg,Beware the price fluctuation. Price dropped shortly after I made reservations.
pos,Location is lovely and there view is awesome. Food there is great too! The manager at the time (Jermaine) addressed my woes (see What didn't you like? section) effectively and we were able to compromise  and it made me a happy customer!
neg,The service in the restaurant was very poor  no attention given   too much dirty tables to clean and no food available in the buffet for breakfast. During dinner the service was very slow too..no follow up coming from the management of the hotel
pos,The staff was competent and efficient.  They accommodated requests and were very polite and friendly.  The breakfast was wonderful considering the variety of dishes served.
neg,No bathtub
pos,The view is excellent
neg,Our room allocated was in the basement with no view whatsoever. It felt like a prison. After complaining we got a view of a concrete courtyard which kept the prison scheme but at least we could see the sky. We had to wait 15 mins to be seated for breakfast both weekend days. This place is uber busy and if you don't like noisy kids  think twice. Room was ok but nearly needed to take a taxi ride from main reception ;)
pos,Nice staff  big room
neg,Some of the furniture (sofa  bath tub) were a bit dated. Not much vegetarian food options in the breakfast buffet.
pos,Spending my birthday at Taal Vista  was a great decision! The staff were very accommodating  and even gave me a complimentary birthday cake! :)
neg,Make the room fixtures at par with the 7k price tag.
pos,View was stunning. Near casino and Sky Ranch amusement park. Staff were very friendly and welcoming.
pos,The view of the Taal lake from thw room was magnificent. The staff were courteous and accommodating.
pos,Food was great!
neg,No bidet in the bathroom
pos,Excellent buffet selection!
neg,Not too much to do inside the hotel  i hope they have added facilities like kids play area  sports center and other leisure activities.
pos,breakfast
neg,This is a massive property. We were next to the banquet / convention facilities and had to walk through the lobby for that section of the hotel to gain access to our room. I felt a bit uncomfortable walking through a formal wedding reception in my t-shirt and shorts. Our room was very  very far from main lobby and restaurant area. The resort was undergoing big remodelling projects during our stay.
pos,The rooms were so cozy and spacious.
neg,The towels are old and threadbare.
pos,I booked the room for my sister celebrating their wedding anniversary. The staff sent them a cake with a greeting which was a very nice gesture.
neg,Rooms are a bit outdated
pos,Incredible view!
neg,The veranda cafe was under construction...we had to walk far to get to our rooms!!  Premier lake view rooms!  Still a nice stay
pos,the view of taal and the delicious breakfast featuring native dishes from batangas
neg,I cant extend my stay.  I little bit expensive though it's worth the stay.

neg,There were less vegetarian options in the meals.
pos,Internet connection is very fast
pos,Property is very well maintained Ambience of Taal view is excellent
neg,Toilet has no bidet.
pos,The breakfast buffet is excellent
neg,Should give more info and assistance to guests about the facilities and place to be able to explore more
pos,Overview room
neg,Some facilities are under renovation
pos,The view. The room. The hospitality.
neg,We can hear everything that is happening in the other room.it makes us really uncomfortable
pos,Swimming pool nd rooms
neg,The mountain view assigned to us was overlooking what seems to be a home/residence. Not sure if that is a place for the staff. Didn't want to seem intrusive as we can see them from up our room. Also  they should check the remote controls for the a/c and TV is properly functioning. We had to call for help but it's something that could have been avoided easily.
pos,The view and location
neg,I thought that the quality of the food was poor. Meals were oily.
pos,Very helful and courteous
neg,The washroom - it's not clean. The bath tub and the floor is dirty.
pos,The buffet breakfast was amazing
pos,Staff was professional  warm and friendly. Their approach seemed 'real' and customized. Even with some setbacks with breakfast buffet  they made us feel priority. Food was great. Lounge was nice. Room was clean and spacious with a comfortable bed.. Also  thank you for being very thoughtful in giving us two surprise birthday cakes. That was sweet gesture =)
pos,Good food (breakfast) and the bed is very comfortable
neg,No night swimming
pos,Swimming  breakfast buffet  the view of taal lake from the terrace
neg,The aircon in our room was not working.  It was night time when it finally got fixed.
pos,The view... the peace... the ambiance.
neg,n/a
pos,breakfast
neg,Small hallway going to rooms Smaller room for the price we paid compared to other hotels
pos,The breakfast buffet  pool  view
neg,Really expensive and food was not upto the mark.
pos,Great location
neg,Better and more prompt customer service  we were checked 2 hours late when in fact we arrived more than 30mins ahead of our ETA
pos,The room and the breakfast buffet
neg,The lunch served on day 1 of convention.
pos,The view  comfort and security of place. Will definitely be back for leisure.
neg,I cannot think of anything as of the moment.
pos,The place is over looking the Taal Volcano as well as the Taal lake. The sumptuous breakfast made our day since we enjoyed the food being served.
neg,I didn't expect that 1 of our room is in the basement  and the towels are old  I think that's the bad part..but overall it was great  I want to stay again at Taal vista hotel nxt time when I go to Tagaytay.
pos,Food is good  both in taste & quality.
pos,Breakfast was great  there's a lot of chooses but I forgot to try the dessert. The beds are comfy  one thing I noticed in our room in the basement our towels are old. The other 2 rooms we have was excellent  the big kids enjoyed their rooms.
neg,One of our room is in the basement  I didn't expect that...I think that's it.
pos,I like the staff very accommodating  nice view of taal lake & the breakfast was great
neg,Brkfast Buffet did not have corned beef/daing bangus
pos,Very accomodating staff; Taza food was perfect!
neg,There was one staff (during breakfast) who was rude I forgot her name  it's been almost a month since our stay ...  I wish I rated this right away though ...  anyways ... We just considered it as a glitch  to otherwise a perfect spring break!
pos,Our room was spacious and clean! Would definitely go back! 
neg,Nothing
pos,The views and the buffet!
neg,You have to ask something like a teaspoon  it should be already there by the time you eat coz part of the eating table.
pos,The bed is comportable and the food is v.good
neg,The bathroom was too modern. There is no door separating the T&B from the room. It was clean though!
pos,Unbeliveable view
neg,-bathtub  it looked very old and unclean. I didnt want to go in at first.
pos,Food choices were great and the cultural show was a bonus
pos,The view so relaxing.
pos,The bed was comfy  the aircon cold. It was a good stay!
pos,-Breakfast buffet spread -so much space in the room and bathroom
neg,The A/C in room 470 was not working well.  The hallway outside the room was also very warm.
pos,Location was fantastic  food was great and the service out of this world.
neg,We were given rooms they called ground floor but it's like basement
pos,I was satisfied with my mom & dad''s room 265  overlooking taal lake... The view has surprised my dad on his special day
neg,Attraction with the place. It needs more attraction to enjoyed
pos,Both beds were huge and comfy
neg,Rooms are very far
pos,Location  Bathroom smelled
neg,The Avis cars and drivers they hire out are extremely expensive and the particular driver we had left us feeling unsafe.
pos,We liked the food  all staff were friendly and the room is clean.
neg,Bathroom had no door and toliet had no bidet
pos,Room is clean and we beautiful view of Taal
neg,It is much better if you would install a bidet in the comfort  room because it was very inconvenient and also the elevator it should be a little bigger and it needs repair because it doesn't look good
pos,View coffee shop
pos,Beautiful views  great value
pos,The room is so comfortable with a nice lake view
neg,they gave us a room too far from the entrance  with 2 flights of stairs and no elevator  the view from the room is an ugly overgrown lawn  towels are old and thin
pos,the lobby  the picturesque view from the hotel grounds overlooking Taal lake  great breakfast selection  big sized rooms and bathroom
neg,They failed to cancel the security deposit posted on my card. Worse  even doubled the amount held. I tried to have it corrected but my first request only resulted to the cancellation of the 1st oversight. I had to call again a couple of days to remind them that they had not completely corrected the mistake.
pos,Taal Vista is a good place to relax though.
neg,Very very very bad wifi  Rooms need maintenance  Bathroom is not clean at all and needs maintenance as well
pos,Amazing breathtaking views over the Taal lake and volcano  Friendly staff Great breakfast buffet Good location mot far from the lake as well as the shopping malls
neg,The food was not good. I think it is overpriced. I asked for extra bed  charged me 1800 including brkfast but I woke up at 3am bec I was cold. The blanket with the extra bed too thin so I asked for an extra blanket. Noisy people on the upper floor & room beside us.
pos,Staff was super friendly & helpful. Location is perfect.
neg,No carpets in rooms. Minimum buy amount to sit in coffee lounge.
pos,The view and excellent service
neg,Bed was hard for my liking. During breakfast  there was a wide variety of food on the buffet but was disappointed bec food that's supposed to be hot was cold. No brown sugar or splenda alternative for coffee.
pos,the place is very nice for family relaxation
neg,Long walk from the lobby to the room and far exit door The direction board is bit confusing  i cant find the swimming pool Little preferance for breakfast buffet
pos,Always good food. Their bistek tagalog was my favorite.
pos,Alexes staff member from cafe Veranda helped a lot with our small baby. Coming back to the hotel for the 4th time like it a lot. Truffles from housekeeping is a good idea.
neg,it's our first time to travel as newly weds and looking forward in staying and celebrating Feb14 at Taal Vista Hotel however  -after checking in no one assisted us to our room  we have to look for it by ourselves. -hated the view of our room  they said (front desk) that the view will be the garden but apparently it's not. -made a reservation at cafe veranda only to find out that our names are not on the list.
pos,Great staff and great view.
neg,Hidden fees were a big surprise.
pos,The buffet breakfast  the views of Taal Lake and accesibility of the place with other places of interest.
neg,Long walk for older guests from the front desk to the rooms although good exercise.
pos,breakfast excellent
neg,toilet privacy
pos,The bed is extra comfy !
neg,Cold food at breakfast buffet
pos,The scene was fantastic
neg,all was good  a little old and pricy considering price paid but unsure if any better options around the area
pos,staff and service  good food  comfortable rooms
neg,Poor connection of internet
pos,Restaurants serve nice food  wonderful musical performance and marvellous view of Taal Lake.
neg,No bidet. Toiletries are ordinary. Towels are thin and donot look properly washed- dirty white.
pos,An amazing views  facilities  foods  good quality of service...
pos,The location facing Taal Lake is relaxing. The staff are hospitable and courteous.
neg,No toilet spray. Price is not reasonable for a room without a good view and balcony. I felt disappointed  I was not given a chance to upgrade my reservation to Balikbayan package.
pos,Nice location
neg,no bidet or water spray in the toilet.
pos,Amazing location
neg,Old furniture and so so rooms
pos,Location
neg,Rooms are old. The door handle in our room looks like it went through haphazard repair. The bathtub is old and stained. Paint peeling. Lighting needs improvement. (We were placed in the old wing-- maybe the new wing is better)
pos,Right beside Skyranch.
neg,I found the breakfast buffet lacking in food choices. i wish there was a bidet in the bathroom.
pos,The location was excellent  near reataurants  it had the best view of  the lake. I had a very relaxing bath with the hot water and bathtub. Service was excellent.
neg,We were not given the room with view
pos,Celebrated my birthday here in Taal Vista and it's one of the most memorable! :-) they prepared something for me in my room and gave all the request we asked  the best staff I've seen in a hotel! Will book this hotel for my wedding for sure.
neg,The swimming pool could have been heated.
pos,Buffet!
neg,They should give the rooms a revamp. The floortiles in our room were loose... Breakfast was plenty but mediocre.
pos,Everything except for the swimming pool.
pos,Beatifull location. Tranquility  away from Manila
neg,The rooms are far from the lobby.  The hallways are long  there are no chairs to at least rest after the long walk.  The elevator is not strategically located and you will lose your breath if you are getting the room with balcony.  There's another elevator that you can reach after climbing the stairs.  Not advisable for seniors but they have wheelchairs for those who need assistance. My mom stayed in the room alone until I arrived before midnight  creepy but she said she heard someone snoring behind her while she was sitting by the writing table.  Not sure if there are stories of this kind in the same room  just wanted to let you know :)  We just slept with the TV and lights on instead. :) CIGNAL's cable signal goes on and off.
pos,I like that the hotel is far from the busy area near Lourdes Church though a quiet place for a church is much appreciated. The room is spacious but VERY FAR TO REACH!  Bathroom is also spacious with complimentary toiletries.  They have an iron and ironing board.  The bed is comfortable.  Take note that we stayed in the new building. The buffet has a lot of choices and are being refilled as soon as it's empty.  They have a good spread.  They have juices and fruits.  The bread items are a bit hard.  Staff are very helpful. The main buidling is elegantly designed.
neg,The aircon was leaking.
pos,The food was good. Staffs were nice. Security was good also.
neg,I would say the only thing that bothered me was the availability of the pool. It closed at 7:00pm. I was there for a wedding and with all the practice and things going  I would have liked to relaxed in the pool when I got back to the hotel.
pos,I really appreciate the staff and how kind they were. They we very helpful and responded quickly to me and my girlfriend's needs. The hotel overall was very clean as well. And the view at the lookout was amazing.
neg,The unit we stayed was very near the water pump/water heater and it keeps on working overnight. My wife can't sleep
pos,The staff is very attentive and courteous  foods was great and the view of taal is stunning
neg,There's no videt in bathrooms.
pos,I liked the privacy and the way my needs were accomodated by the staff. I was able to rest and relax which i badly needed that time.
neg,None  i think
pos,Banquet service
neg,rooms feel outdated
pos,The location/view is perfect
neg,The facilities are quite worn out and old. The hotel needs improvement.
pos,I requested for early check-in and the staff was kind enough to grant my request.  The staff are all accommodating and the place is very clean.  It makes our stay in Tagaytay really relaxing!
pos,the location  the view of the volcano
neg,No assistance from the staff taking you to your designated room
pos,Food
neg,My visitors at lake view side stayed at premier rooms on the third floor. We went the circuitous way when in fact there is a shorter route via 2nd floor lift. There should be a written instruction to guests regarding this info
pos,Immense improved faculties since the old Taal Vista Lodge
neg,the sink in our bathroom was a little clogged  the water takes time to disappear. The shower curtain smells bad.
pos,the view from the view deck is just fantastic. the breakfast buffet was also very good!
neg,Room not available on check-in time.
pos,I like the food they serve at the buffet.
neg,None so far. Better if they have bath tubs in the cr
pos,Front desk dennise was very friendly
neg,If the exhaust is not running you can smell foul odor (probably from a leak in sewage vent line in ceiling void).
pos,the location -along the ridge  overlooking the Taal Volcano..
neg,expensive to stay longer period of time
pos,Accessible to many amenities and with mini park at the back of the hotel
neg,Bathrooms can be cleaner as well as the chairs and beds.
pos,The nearness of the hotel to taal volcano. The view.
neg,A tad overpriced.
pos,Close to restaurants. Best view of Taal volcano. Big rooms. Big bed. Beautiful hotel.
neg,Too expensive to get the taal view
pos,View  location  availability on peak season

pos,View  breakfast  staff
neg,Can improve the taste of the food. And install a bidet in the toilet.
pos,The site gives a fantastic view of Taal Volcano.
neg,hassle check-in even if confirmed booking and all special requests have been coordinated morethan a month prior to check-in  but when you check-in  you have to tell everything all over again... that's what you get from being so nice.  rooms have to be renovated
pos,Property location
neg,None
pos,Excellent view of taal volcano. Good location.
neg,Housekeeping was a littleslow but I was there on a weird time Big storm and double weddings kept them running

neg,Lack of signs or instructions going to our room.
pos,Excellent view
neg,Internet connection turns on and off.
pos,The view of the lae.
neg,It was not worth the money the breakfasts were not of good quality  table in the restaurant was dirty  no good coffee or fresh juice. In the room only one small shower gel and one small shampoo for 2 people  which was nearly enough for one.the games room has old and very damaged billiard table  pool is only opened till 6:00pm.Half of the devices at the gym are damaged. I think we overpaid for this hotel and it would not be my choice for second stay. IF hotel wants to charge this high amount for room  they shall adjust service to the highest standards as well.
pos,The view was great.rooms were very clean.
neg,the checkin was a bit slow. but its ok we were greeted warmly and with drinks.
pos,the buffet breakfast was good. our deluxe room is very comfy. an additional single bed was provided without a fee its definitely a plus for a fa ily of 2 adults and 2 kids.thank you Taal Vista.
neg,Poor internet connection
pos,Very good place so relaxing
neg,Toilet bowl had water stain ring
pos,The staff are friendly accomodating and very helpful great location and i really feel safe in this hotel
neg,A bit pricey
pos,Taza restaurant - excellent food and service
neg,On 2nd day the aircon unit was leaking and bathtub drainage is not properly draining which is so unhygiene to wash inside the tub. We stayed in room 269 lake view...pls try to install bidet as well. We need it so badly for hygiene-wise.
pos,Best view of Taal Volcano and lake
pos,Tranquility and serene location.
pos,We've love the viee.. amazing
neg,The price at Booking is much expensive and unreasonable compared to rack rates
pos,People are nice
neg,There's a bug in our room. Breakfsst buffet has changed. I like their selection before.
pos,Thank you for having staffs like denise and mimi
neg,None
pos,Location and surroundings.
neg,A highly rated hotel but no dry cleaning  it might not be cost effective but should recommend an alternative...
pos,Great location. Relaxing stay
neg,Poor coordination.
pos,Accommodating and friendly staff  awesome food from Taza Fresh Table
neg,Some staff at dining area give more attention to foreign guests than us local guests.
pos,Staff are all courteous and very accommodating. Hotel is very  very clean as in spotless. Food is great. I needed antacid at night but the nurse was on break. One staff sent the med to our room.
pos,checking in and checking out were very smooth. staff were so friendly.
pos,Security  I rate them 9  a highly secured place  it is much better with the casino gone. I would highly recommend the place to my co-workers   friends and families.While I was young  My Tatay on our way home to Batangas always stop by at the historic coffee shop. Thanks to concierge  front office  restaurant staff  Housekeeping and Security staff.
pos,I liked the food & ambience.sim
neg,no carpets  no bidet
pos,the ambience!
neg,Our Room facing canyon ranch has a not so nice view. Down below also you can see the old Christmas tree that was uses before and some other junk.
pos,Room is nice . Helpful staff members. Good
neg,It would have been better if the fruit juices in the breakfast buffet were freshly squeezed instead of being powdered concentrate. Also  it would have been more exciting if there were native delicacies in the breakfast fare  as these would go well with the native chocolate drink or even coffee.
pos,The place is elegant and clean  especially the new wing.   The panoramic view of the Taal lake/volcano was exhilarating.
neg,Housekeeping were not efficient & consistent
pos,Staff were very helpful
neg,They didn't accommodate my request prior to my stay from Sunday to Wednesday.
pos,The Amadeo Barako coffee
neg,Room service
pos,Hotel area
neg,There is no separated door for the toilet and no handy spray ...
pos,Our room view.
neg,the toilet bowl was unclean. maybe it was the recycled water  but it was very unpleasant.
pos,Location   and everything in the hotel is super nice  ..
neg,We were given the wrong area lake view 419instead of mountain view ( written - check in paper). No one assisted us so we walked on our own to reach the area. We saw a guard but instructed as to go to different area(from right side towards the left most side- mountain view to lake view). Upon reaching there  we were told that we have to walk all the way to the other side of the property.  And that 419 is mountain view n not lake view. They told us that the paper was wrong. We were carrying our bags by ourselves with no one assisting  or guiding us.
pos,it has the best view of the lake and the volcano. the staff is super friendly.
neg,The gate to the Sky Ranch closes at 6pm :(
pos,the place and location
neg,The rooms that we got were in the old wing and we were right smack in the middle of guests with their families that if not noisy  rowdy and kids that like to throw tantrums left and right. The room details on the choices could have indicated if the rooms were in the old or new wing. The process of profiling guests could have been done just so big families with kids can be put on certain floors/wings. Thanks.
pos,Overall  i really like the place with ALL their friendly staff.  Perhaps to have healthier food on the menu -- even vegan would be nice :)
neg,Nothing
pos,special shout out to Kevina. she went out of her way to get me a birthday cake thus making my birthday special. thank you
neg,Pools timing
pos,Been here a couple of times. Still very satisfied.
neg,Cable tv has only 1 channel. The housekeeping failed to repair it.
pos,Taal vista still has the most magnificent view of the volcano and taal lake. Rooms were clean and complete toiletries were provided.
pos,foods are nice and all the staff are polite.
pos,Everything.
pos,View
pos,The scenery and friendliness of staff
pos,Go for the Premier Rooms since it got a superb view. When it comes to food  breakfast buffet got a nice selection and Taza Fresh Table Restaurant is a must try. You can't go wrong with Taal Vista.
neg,The room
pos,The View and The Veranda Resto
neg,The lack of trolleys (and probably insufficient staff) that led to the staff unable to assist the guest during check out (peak hours) is dosappointing. We waited for 1 hour for the luggage assistance and no one came despite several front desk promises. So we were obliged to carry our luggages (note that my wife is pregnant) all the way from the 4th flr to the lobby!
pos,The landscape garden and accessibility to sky ranch and restobar
neg,Bed is not comfortable  most of the staff are not friendly.   We booked for a room service spa at 10:30pm but no one showed up. I thought they're just late so I waited for 30mins and called to find out that our booking was not endorsed by the staff to the night shift therapist.
pos,We liked the view of the lake.
neg,the door key more mentainance check need
pos,Friendly staff
neg,The food from room service such as the thin crust pizza and buffalo wings wasn't hot and fresh anymore. But the staff was super friendly.
pos,Thanks to the staff for the clean tub it was too chilly for our kid to swim in the pool that day! Breakfast buffet was good too!
neg,Room was dated. Bed was uncomfortable.
pos,We love the ambience at the veranda and enjoyed the recreation room
pos,I liked everything about Taal Vista. From the service  location  and all the staff. Super friendly.
pos,the view and facilities so good
pos,I liked the veggie and fruit selection of the buffet esp greek salad  tzaziki  red egg w/ tomatoes  guava salad  balsamic dressing... Loved the garden and taal lake view. I love the clean bathroom and rooms. The stone massage offered by the Asmara Spa was great.
pos,Location
neg,Swimming pool
pos,The staffs
neg,Almost nothing :)
pos,Everything is good :)
neg,The problem with our door.
pos,Tha view
neg,NOISY!!! Theres an ongoing construction and it can be heard from my room
pos,Clean..  My room was new
neg,Our room was on the ground floor and its not that clean. We were disappointed. 
pos,The million dollar view!
neg,Nothing!
pos,The hotel was nice. Great views from the room. As always in SE Asia  staff fantastic. Food and drink well priced
neg,Not good value for money. Noisy room  can hear all from upstairs and in the hallways. Bed was comfortable but again nothing special.
pos,Beautiful location   garden terrace and lake view
neg,Staff
pos,The view
neg,Hotel supervision and reception staff not very friendly.
pos,The view overlooking Taal volcano.
neg,The aircon and fridge in our room needs a replacement --- the aircon keeps a fairly comfortable 23-25 degree room temp despite being set at 18 degrees at maximum fan  thanks to the cool weather outside at the time; and the fridge cools the complimentary bottled water after at least 12 hours despite a maximum cooling setting.  Understandably the Mountain Wing is pretty dated but good management should not have waited for guest comments to address a basic housekeeping/engineering issue like this. Front office staff should refrain from making promises that could not be delivered  such as offering to send a fruit basket to the room for our wedding anniversary  but nada.
pos,Staff (i.e. front office  Veranda/Fireplace/F&B  bell staff  and those you simply meet in the hallway) were generally very courteous.  Check-in and checkout went smoothly.
neg,Hotel has an old style hence the old feel which is not my liking; the towels feel like they're 5yrs old as it wasn't fluffy anymore. Even if the room is clean it doesn't feel clean because of the old feel. The rooms are also a far walk from the lobby.
pos,The location was great and the view is amazing. They have a big viewing area which adds to the ambiance.
neg,No foreign currency exchange on the property.
pos,The overlooking scenery
neg,1. Food was basic yet expensive 2. We were thrown in 2 lousy locations in the mountain wing despite advance bookings. 3. Someone tried to open our door while we were inside. 4. Room was available past 3pm  no refund or explanation given 5. Wifi wasnt working inside  they had to fix it on site 6. Massage service was a fail. We booked for 2 yet they only sent 1 therapist.  Overall  fair but lousy service. I wont recommend this place. Also there were a lot of customers unhappy with their service and 1 old lady made a scene last sunday due to her room not being available and she was already late for the event. No value for money!
pos,Excellent view of the lake  convenient to sky ranch  delicious and wide choices on breakfast buffet. Staffs are friend and goes above and beyond.
neg,None! Everything was awesome!like seriously awesome. Far exceeded my expections!
pos,Breakfast and scenery
neg,room are old and not so clean  bed sheet is too old.
pos,Excellent food. Very spacious room. The staff are very courteous.
neg,Room  hotel  amenities all need updating. For the high price we paid for the room  it wasn't worth it.
pos,Great hotel with the best view in town Great breakfast
neg,The bacon should not be covered  its loses the crispness.
pos,The breakfast buffet offered variety of yummy foods to choose from. Vey nice accommodation

pos,Locatiom
neg,None
pos,Staff were very courteous
neg,Poor service. Dont have enough parking space for the guest.
pos,The view was amazing.The food was execellent. The service was outstanding.
neg,The ventilation in the CR  (exhaust  fan cannot control the smell of the restroom.. as well as the sound proofing of the room  we heard the voices of the other people beside our room
pos,I like the food however it was too expensive
neg,The t.v signal
pos,Staff and frontlins are all accomodating
neg,Breakfast service was terrible! Hotel guests were made to wait in line for a table. Hotel staff were unable to handle the queue well.
pos,Staffs are very accommodating.  Classy rooms and interior..
neg,Overpriced room  no bathtub not even a bidet in the CR...  staff would always say they are short in numbers. Refused to deliver our packed breakfast as we were all busy getting ready for a wedding! my brother in law had to do the bellboys job in pushing the cart to our room. Had to walk very far from the lobby also and it was a problem for my mother in law who had a knee operation. And please stop confusing clients by offering  LAKE WING rooms but the rooms are facing walls or nothing...
pos,The view is always spetacular! The grounds are well maintained and offers a great view of Taal Lake. Spacious parking area. Great location. Clean rooms.
neg,Not up to 5 star standard u claim to be. Furniture was old and broken. Bathroom was dull  old with a terribly bad smelling shower curtain.
pos,The staffs were all friendly  a beatiful environment to relax.
neg,You need to check your rooms in Mountain wing  we are disappointed considering you are rated 5Star Hotel??? Check Rm 123
pos,Lobby
neg,Plug adapters shld b readily available for tourists
pos,Food was excellent. Staff very helpful & efficient
neg,It's not the hotel the transportation system of the city
pos,Foods were excellent
neg,Breakfast is so expensive it's not worth paying too much  no other choices . I got 4 rooms and.requested a lake view  upon checked in but kept saying no room available
pos,Breakfast
neg,The room is so plain just like an ordinary room so old no tub no veranda not worth the price of 9500 per night really. The frontdesk officers not pleasant the breakfast disaster they dont have available table gor all the guests because they entertained walkin costumers
pos,the service  staff  food and our room was so clean and good. we will come definitely come back.
neg,Nothing much to do.  Spa room not very inviting. It needs improvement. Looked very dark and not used a lot by guests.
pos,Pastries and the backyard
pos,The Staff. They are very warm and accommodating.
neg,Elevators were too small
pos,Facilities and service
pos,good service  nice room and delicious food.. love to have my vacation again in this hotel
neg,Well  in the middle of the night the aircon is not working. I woke up and call them  wait them until they finish working after more than an hour. At breakfast this girl in the reception buffet area is so choosy to the guest. When we get there she asked us what room number and  she turned her back to us to assist another guest  then after that she assist me again by telling me that we could sit OUTSIDE the buffet area because the sits are all reserved. I said to her that other dining area is not allowed because i ask the other employee about that and then i said that no one is sitting in that couch (inside the buffet dining area)  She just said that if i could share my table to someone else  and said fine. While  eating i noticed that this receptionist is likes to entertain mostly with foreigners. If  foreigners the sits are available. What a shame.  Well  the food is not worthy also.. and no one dare to share my table because there are a lot of empty tables...
pos,Wifi  ambiance and front desk receptionist it's easy to check in and check out.
neg,buffet breakfast and receptionists
pos,cleanliness
neg,Long walk to stairs to get u to elevator then floor. Inconvienent!!
pos,The view!! Friendliness of staff! And they truly cared u were there.
neg,I like the lake wing view
pos,Please improve your staff services very lousy. you need to have a staff development program.  The room that I booked through online is not the room I expected when I get there. I requested primier queen but they give me two beds. I am dis appointed
neg,The hotel is kind of expensive. Cleanliness can be improved more.  Only 1 treadmill was working at the gym. No TV to watch while on the treadmill.
pos,The bed was comfy. The room was spacious. Location is really good. Really nice view of  the volcano and lake.
neg,The was not enough tables at breakfast venue. We had to wait.
pos,Everything was  perfect
neg,Their staff opened our hotel room without even knocking. This happened 3X in the span of our overnight stay. I felt really offended. They are not trained to knock first before entering a room. I filed a complaint through the front desk  but no one has gotten back to me regarding the incident.
pos,The location of the hotel is perfect. But the room given to us is misleading. I chose lake view  but the only view we got was the skyranch rides that are not pleasing.
pos,Food
neg,The hotel is old. Supposed to be historical but really it's just old and worn out  rough around the edges. All the money they charge appears to be going into someone's pocket as it clearly isn't being invested back into the hotel. Most rooms do not have a view so do be surprised if your window faces a wall or the casino across the street. No service at the pool. 150php for a bucket of ice. Breakfast buffet isn't really all that great especially when considering this hotel is supposed to be super awesome. Rooms are very basic and worn out. Mold and mildew on shower walls. Bathroom sink enamel completely worn through in some places. Hair in bathtub upon arriving. Mattress is old and isn't attached to the wall so it easily slides away from the wall of you try to sit up and lean against the wall. Linens are also very worn out (sheets and blanket and towels). There is only one outlet that works with 3 prong plugs (e.g. Laptop cable) and not conveniently located. Room really seems more like a cheap motel than an elegant hotel. For the cost one should have pretty high expectations. Be warned you should lower your expectations. Then lower them some more.  There are a bunch of hotels and b&b along the ridge  you can probably save some money and stay at a better place if you look around. Don't waste your money here. If you have to leave your room to see the view anyway then stay somewhere less expensive and spend the day at various points. You can always just come visit the hotel property if you want this particular view. Oh yeah  and the layout is a little weird. Depending on which room you get be prepared to do a lot of walking. A lot. Read other people's reviews  you'll see a pattern.
pos,There is a nice view but it is a long ridge and there are lot of places with nice views. They keep the back part of the property in good order.
neg,Beds slightly hard
pos,Oversll slk stay food n sunday mass
neg,We lost 1 bag when we checke out . The bell boy brought our things down..
pos,Although we booked lake wing   it did not have any view of the lake   which is misleading   Howver Ailine took care of us very well upgraded us to a room which has a great view of the lake .. thanks very professional and understanding staff .. we loved it ... Romantic dinner was super   my wife loved it .. Thanks Joyce for arranging the same as per my wife's taste .. Over we loved it
neg,to improve Breakfast not up to a 5 star level ..
pos,very friendly staff.
neg,nothing
pos,Just the location.
neg,I traveled with a senior citizen with 4 kids  I was given the farthest room without elevators. It was the longest walk in our life before you get to relax.  That was the baddest first time experience in the hotel.
pos,bed was comfy.breakfast was good.staff was friendly and helpful.
neg,We were given a room with a broken bathroom door. Although we were transfered to new one  that is after we requested to but still they should have not allocated that room to any of their guests on the first place. It's a waste of time to transfer after you've settled in the room only to find out later that something is broken. They should also improve on their check-in time as well. For the price we payed for a deluxe two-bedroom suite  it's not worth it!!
pos,Lovely place and very service oriented staff. Recommend the lake view wing  breathtaking!
neg,comfort room toilet bowl  glass partition had smudges. comfort room floor tile grouting was dirty.i thought i will get a lakeview window bec the booking stated that it is a lake bldg.to my dismay it was not.
neg,Nome  nada!!Excellent hotel
neg,everything is good.
pos,The room were nice.the breakfast was yummy!:)
neg,Bed too hard Food just ok. Not too many choices Front desk staff sucks
pos,cool weather
neg,Dirty room  and it was not ready.
pos,The scenic view of taal volcano  its premium facilities  staff were very accommodating  it is just beside the sky ranch  accessible to public transport and  the name itself which is already a landmark by history
neg,None  i really love the place
pos,Location
neg,Mountain wing is old and the beds are sagging. Needs an upgrade.  The lake wing - note not all rooms in the lake wing have the view of the lake as mine looked out to the street; is a newer building but has bad shower drain. The water goes out of the shower cubicle and into the room. I informed the front desk but the lady didn't seem to be interested to hear my feedback.
pos,Closer to wedding venue
neg,Run-down rooms / shower and bathroom fixtures broken
pos,The location
neg,Slow response from staff. No one pick up the call from massage/spa which advertised in the room its available for 24hrs. No one help for carrying luggage even after requesting personally.  Kinda old hotel.
pos,I like that you had an XBOX 360 at the kids corner.  But then  the staff that was working there was late and came around 9:25am.  We were waiting for it to open at 9am but another staff got the key and had us play.  Another thing was that the Samsung tv is broken meaning there are white lines on the tv so we couldn't really play the game.
neg,Almost everything no customer service overpriced buffet old deteriorating rooms bath towels .look like rags because it's too old Requested for luggage assistance nobody showed up hotel price is overpriced.  Before coming to taal I stayed at diamond hotel and the comparison is night and day
pos,They had parking available.
neg,I didn't like the snobbish attitude of your front desk.  I requested something special to be set up on the room for my wife  they didn't listen to my request.  The room that we got was very old  it feels like very 90's  the shower and tub was too old and had hair on the drainage.  I had to request someone to untangle the plug from the drainage as we couldn't use the tub.  Come breakfast time  we went to the Veranda and requested for a coffee.  I'm not sure if the staff is trained well on hospitality specifically on how to brew coffee but it tasted like water (no bitter coffee taste at all).  Ofcourse the pastries were cold and dry  but I think that's why theres someone there to have it toasted.  Overall  it's overrated  overpriced and very old.  You'll be better off at a newer hotel with upbeat staff than this one.
neg,Bedroom sliding window door didnt fully closed so anyone could have gained access to my room through the patio. Poor bathroom lighting to put on make-up. Room service knocked on my door at midnight although I didn't request for anything. Next morning I was woken up by a knock on the door from hotel staff again. Took them 20 mins to seat us at the breakfast buffet and resto was not even full. Food quality was very poor and I couldn't eat it. Extra bed I've requested was never delivered. The list goes on and on but I'll stop here...
neg,A lot of undisclosed charges when I booked. I booked it for P7 700 but when I was made to pay at the front desk  they told me that the final amount was P9 500. In addition to P9 500.00 the hotel staff made me deposit an undisclosed amount of P2 000.00. Even if I was okay to paying said amount  the staff's service was less than okay. We were made to wait more than 1 hour to get our room. When we got to our room  we were also surprised to find that the windows weren't closed properly. We only found out when we could hear the full boom of the fireworks at night. The breakfast was mediocre as well.
pos,Location is excellent. Staff are friendly.
neg,The Hotel rooms in the old wing could use a face-lift. Litter such as plastic wrappers  bottle caps and cigarettes were visible from our room's mini veranda.
pos,Loved the experience of being in Tagaytay. The place is really nice and comfortable. Staff is excellent. My family loves the fact that SkyRanch is just next door.
neg,Very old towels n beddings TV n furnishings poor working condition
pos,Love the wide selection of food and everything is well prepared and was just cooked perfectly.
neg,I wish the swimming pool was heated.. it's Tagaytay  so you can imagine how cold the water would be around Jan-Feb..
pos,rooms are too old and not clean well
neg,The passenger capacity of the elevator for my family didn't fit in a single ride.
pos,Taal Vista is the premium place to stay in Tagaytay  located with excellent views of Lake Taal. The venue has history on its side  with style and comfort. It is only 20 minutes from Sonya's Garden  a tranquil and exotic garden and eating place south of Tagaytay  a must visit place.
neg,any better that value for our money
pos,One of the best view Great breakfast
neg,In travelling to and from Tagaytay  the traffic can be VERY slow  almost at a standstill on weekends. This applies to Taal Vista Hotel and everything else in Tagaytay  situated as it is on the rim of an ancient volcano.
pos,Panoramic c view of Taal volcano
neg,No bidet on toilets. No toys at all in kids club No heated pool Dirty window glass
neg,There is molds and chocroches. Poor service
neg,The lobby and facade looked so beautiful  since I believe they went through a renovation a couple of years ago. However  when we got to our room  it smelled of moth balls and really looked dated. The bathroom was so disappointing. The shower head won't even turn because it's already rusty. The AC kept us up all night because it kept on making noises.
pos,Internet was slow
neg,Impersonal staff  no atmosphere  higher prices.  We have room for two and travel with 6 years old child who should be for free. By the breakfast we were asked to pay for the child (usually eats one muffin and juice) 450 ps - aprox. $10
pos,To be honest  the food  staff  and location were the only saving grace.
neg,There's nothing special
pos,Nice place. Beautifull view on lake. Luxury hotel with good equipment
neg,Recrption
pos,Bacon is good
pos,Veranda staff
neg,Staff only good point
pos,The location...
neg,breakfast menu has few variety. we don't like it that much esp the kids.
pos,The beds very uncomfortable the rooms in bad need of maintenance power points not working or dangerous.doors wont lock. Safe not operating. Aircon leaking. No offer of compensation.left one day early. Absolutely disgusted. Will not recommended to friends.
neg,The room (in the mountain wing) was torn down and downright unclean  we were very disappointed.
pos,the ambiance of the hotel and the view overlooking the taal volcano.
neg,Price  quality of room & breakfast
pos,The location is stunning  breakfast is ok.
pos,Location  view
neg,The room we stayed add did not have a lake view that we were expecting.  You can see the lake but our room was in front of the nearby park and was really noisy. Also the air conditioning unit was leaking so you can hear the water dripping all night.  Also they changed the restaurant to buffet style and service and food is below standard.  I liked the food better before.
pos,Everything.....
neg,The toilet floor is quite slippery so be careful
pos,the manager on duty was veryful but our first day is already spoiled .
neg,BATH ROOM IS NOT  5 -STAR; MOLDS AROUNF BATH TUB. OUR ROOM IS SUPPOOSE TO BE MOUNTAIN VIEW  HOWEVER  I DON'T SEE ANY MOUNTAIN.
pos,Location
neg,Poor wifi connection. Towels musky - rooms lights not bright.
pos,I like all the foods specially the donuts and salads etc
neg,the hotel is overated... our christmas eve was spoiled due to transferring of rooms as i complaint on the low quality of rooms. when you book through booking.com they will give the room in the old buidling which look like a hospital area. Never again on this hotel. Nobody answers the phone in the front desk...
pos,Best hotel i ever tried.  And convenient
neg,Lipstick marks on glasses that I haven't used yet. Slow response of staff
pos,Location
neg,Cable tv is not functioning but we dont care 
neg,Room door mechanism didnt work and everytime had to walk back to reception for them to send an engineer and waited a long time for them to come. Had once to walk back to reception and explain it all over again for them to arrive later. Not happy with the service. Restaurant service poor and slow and one need to ask for help and service.
neg,The windows in my children's rooms  (2x) were very dirty. Our room overlooked a dirty storage area.  The food service at the lobby was so slow and unorganized.  Very disappointed.
neg,Slow service from reception to restaurants. We arrived an hour past check in time but rooms were still not ready. We left our luggage at the concierge but it was left unattended. Nothing was lost but it was still left unsecure.
pos,Rooms were clean
neg,Long queues at reception  room was not ready at check-in  old rooms with thin walls/doors  huge queues at breakfast
pos,Good location  scenic view  helpful front desk manager Aki  kid's room
neg,The weather ( out of your control ) !
pos,The Hotel facilities and accommodation was as good as anywhere else in the world . All the staff were extremely friendly and helpful   especially Paul from security .
neg,Room was old. Taza factory outlet understaffed so the service was so slow.
pos,Staff were so friendly and courteous.
neg,Nothing
pos,Croissants are crunchy delicious! Beds are comfortable and clean!
neg,Love all  really.
pos,The view (make sure you get a lake view room)  the space  the staff  the meals.
neg,Late check in. Room was not ready by 2pm. We checked in at 3pm.  Too bad because i made the booking in advance. (October)
pos,My husband and I loved every bit of our stay. Thank you for having us Taal Vista. 
neg,Superior room way over priced  not clean   well maintained   could hardly see through the dirty windows
pos,Location
neg,The room they initially gave me was not worth what I paid. It was facing an inner courtyard where the view was other rooms. This is a mountain/lakeside property and they charge almost $200 for a room which faces other rooms.  The staff moved me to another room which had a better view but was dirty  the bathroom didn't have a door  the pillows were flat. The room was a disappointment. If only the event I was attending weren't in this property  I would have booked elsewhere.
pos,The staff were very professional  courteous and accommodating
neg,The description in booking.com said the room had a view of the mountain but when we saw the room  the view was facing a wall. Slippers were paper thin.There was no transportation going to the room. Entrance and exit guards didn't seem to know the difference between checked-in hotel guests and walk-in visitors: they looked confused.
pos,The staff at the desk were very efficient specially Cherry. They made sure that we got an early check in due to the fact that we were seniors. Check out was a breeze.
neg,Room quality: Even the lake wing  the rooms are quite dark & shabby  which might have not been renovated over 10 years. The price is too high for such quality.  Breakfast: lot of choice  but too many guests  and hardly any service. No coffee or tea after being seated for 30 minutes. Flies. There are 8 of us  but the staff refused to provide a large table and not allowing to combine 2 tables  until we escalated to the manager. Coffee is like water...
pos,i love the free breakfast and the accommodation.
neg,The room where we stayed was a bit far from where they serve breakfast
pos,The buffet breakfast was okay.
neg,Unfortunately our room.was located in a pocket garden...no view. We requested to.be transfer  however  all rooms overlooking  taal lake was occupied.
pos,Location is good.
neg,Nothing
pos,The place was very nice very good service and the staffs were so helpful and kind
neg,The waitresses of the Taza restaurant are not friendly. grumpyface

pos,Location and comfort.
pos,The view of Taal..
pos,the overlooking view in taal volcano
neg,CHECK IN TIME TOOK 30 MINS CABLE TV SIGNAL WAS INTERMITTENT WIFI WAS VERY SLOW TOILET HAD NO BIDET BUFFET WAS SO SO. ONLY THE EGG STATION SERVED HOT FOODS.
pos,HOUSEKEEPING PERSONNEL WERE ATTENTIVE WHEN WE ASKED FOR EXTRA TOWEL AND BLANKET.
neg,There were lots of fruit flies during our breakfast. On our first day I could not help but to request a housekeeping staff to clean the toilet seat and bowl because I had seen an unpleasant thing on it.but the staffs were all accommodating.there were facilities that need to be improved like the elevator and
pos,I loved the champorado and the breath taking scenery - very close to taal volcano and lake!
neg,There could have been a bidet beside the toilet. And working airconditioner  non leaking aircon would be greatly appreciated if improve; furthermore if improve to a modern type facilities inside the bathroom. Thanks
pos,The ambiance  location and spectacular view of taal lake
neg,I was thinking of having the same level of food choices in Seda Hotel's breakfast buffet. But since that time  I was more focused on taking time to relax  I did not mind the food as long as it is edible and tastes just right.
pos,All staff are courteous  even the maintenance/janitors stop to greet us. The place is very relaxing especially after we just backed out from the neighboring hotel with rude staff  it was worth it being there. I felt special with the 2 apples inside the room. Although the gesture is just a small thing  but the thought of receiving it unexpectedly made us happy.
neg,A rug for the floor in the balcony because it got wet and slippery because of the rain.
pos,The room that we got had a front view of the taal volcano.  Wifi had a strong connection. Beds were soft and comfortable.  The floor in the toilets were not that slippery but it would be nice if there is bath tub included.  Nice interior
neg,Booked a room in the mountain wing  got advised by reception to upgrade and move to the lake wing as the other wing was old and had no view No transport in the area - Avis car trip 11km costs 900 pesos what we paid in in a taxi from Manila to tagaytay! Way back to Manila from hotel - charging 4300 pesos for the same trip Had no aircon in upgraded room for first night as when we complained they didn't come to fix it for an hour and we were already sleeping  the next morning when we were trying to get ready for a wedding it took 1 hour and 6 calls to reception to finally get someone to fix it
pos,Fantastic views if in the right rooms facing the lake!
neg,Nothing
pos,All the place
neg,We arrived there as early as 1pm  we got entertained as soon as we came  but we we'rent able to get into the room until 15mins passed 2pm. The waiting got us little frustrated  coz we saw couple of guests having their early check-ins.
pos,The view of the Taal Volcano is excellent. My family loved it specially my parents.
neg,Fogs
pos,Ambiance
pos,Room is great and mango panacota
neg,The access from the lobby to the room is very lengthy.
pos,We called to provide Feather pillows  and we were glad that they were provided as my wife could not sleep without them. The artists who performed in the Lounge are just great  including Ms. Lacsamana.The SPA Thai massage and foot massage were perfect. Pretty much a great stay!
neg,Instructions not followed.First Instance was during breakfast i ordered hot chocolate along with the breakfast but it did not arrive 2nd instance was during check out-i specifically called for advance check out since i cannot stand for a very long time due to my injury in the legs but i still stood in line waiting to get checked out third i was standing about to ride my car when this guy from the hotel with all the luggages just passed by me and i almost fell from the gutter
pos,Beautiful view!!!
neg,The ants on the balcony kept us from having coffee on the balcony in the morning!!
pos,location
neg,the hot shower wasnt working. complained and they gave me a P500 discount. but total amount i paid was 12 900 while the booking.com figure at the email was only almost P11 000. upon arrival and clarifiction  was told that said amount does not include taxes.
pos,Cleanliness
neg,Hidden charges !
pos,Confusion made at the reception area about the booking & charging
neg,no aircon
pos,The place - cleanliness and comfy of the place.
neg,My room looked different from what I've booked here in Agoda.
neg,The long wait at the reception
neg,Rooms bit far  no jacuzzi in the pool area since climate there is colder. Buffet breakfast not good and not of international standards.
pos,The location and view is good. Weather is cool.
neg,All
pos,Nothing
pos,The pastries is so good!
neg,we checked in  at 230pm and the room is not ready yet.. also theyre having problems in my room key ..room is too far from the lobby .. you need a roller blades.. my husband and i are both senior citizens
pos,Excellent staff; very comfortable rooms; ideal location was given to us
neg,More stable internet connection in the rooms.
pos,Awesome stay
neg,The air-conditioning unit was not working and the rest room door locks were damaged. Breakfast was so ordinary. Been billed higher than what was posted online hence I called the staff attention to check rates.
pos,Fantastic view to the Taal Volcano. Great room service and friendly and helpfull staff.
neg,Check in time took soo long  then there was no available room and I was made to wait for one hour  only to find out that the room was ready in 30mins.
pos,Staff are nice and very professional.
neg,none
pos,view
neg,Our room was far from the main entrance and dining area. Walking is not a problem but there was no elevator in our wing and no ramp for our baby's stroller. We had to drag it several flights of stairs while carrying the baby. Such a hassle.
pos,Excellent location of hotel. Room is big and spacious. Much appreciated since we have an active toddler in tow.
neg,I requested for a two bed  I indicate it with my reservation but they gave me 1 queen size bed. Then when I requested for a two bed they told me that they are fully booked and they cannot accomodate my request. I've been there lots of times  they should improve their service when they are fully booked. they can't accomodate well because of that.  great breakfast though.
pos,all the staff is very friendly and accomodating.
neg,Few choices for breakfast
pos,Amazing View from the porch   a masterpiece  everything is good in the hotel   like bed comfort  the room capacity   the crew   the hotel site   and I would recommend everyone to take a room that comes with a porch  because you will be missing a lot if you don't   ya it's a little bit expensive  but it's worth it   trust me   and also I recommend if ordering from room service  the Cuorgettes Pasta   it is magnificent .
neg,The rooms are outdated & bedroom linens are not smooth & comfortable to touch. Pool is not heated considering the year round cool weather. The way to the basement parking is too narrow.
pos,The location was awesome. The bathroom toiletries are at par with Japan hotel standard except for the amenities like the bidet.
neg,The promo price on the booking and the room wasn't the same. It wasn't as advertised. and the check-in time took 30 minutes.
pos,I truly appreciated the assistance that was given by our reservations officer  Ms. Jeramie Pasion. She was really helpful in responding to all of our queries and needs. I would also like to thank Julian from the front desk for his excellent service and making sure that my senior parents got the correct discount.
neg,Our room looked nothing like the photos in the website. We were supposed to get an extra large double bed  but upon checking in  none were available  so they just joined two small and uncomfortable beds together. The exposed floor was quite dusty! Decor was sad and pathetic. The advertised Garden or Taal Ridge view was non-existent from our Mountain Wing room. Quite a disappointment for an expensive hotel.
pos,Apart from the decent location  the breakfast buffet and the view of the volcano from the viewing deck area were the only things we liked at this hotel.
neg,Nothing.
pos,Everything. 
neg,Room guests should have been informed earlier that the Fresh Table restaurant was closed for a private function  the childrens play room was closed. Would have liked a bathtub in our Premier room
pos,The attentiveness of the staffs to detail  the warmth of their welcome which displayed their sincerity  the food served  the facilities at the hotel
pos,Our stay was excellent. Staff was the most accomodating ive experience in a long time. Will definitely come back and recommend to friends.
neg,None
pos,All the staff were very accommodating and made sure that we were comfortable in our rooms. The buffet breakfast was sumptuous. The front desk staff always serve with a smile from check in to check out. They were proactive in dealing with guest and made sure that each guest request were acted upon appropriately. We really had a wonderful weekend. 
neg,We weren't able to use the in-room entertainment because the cable provider's digibox is broken.
pos,Staff were more than accommodating. Spa was a must-visit during our stay.
neg,Right now it's not worth of 5 stars in my opinion. The breakfast isn't a good experience (not enough staff most of the times and impossible on Saturday morning  leaking A/C  had to wait for coffee...) The mountain wing shows its age.
pos,The location is really nice.
neg,None
pos,All food is good!
neg,The bed and pillows wer not comfortable. Bed is too hard  as well as the pillows were too flat
pos,The view of lake Taal -the entertainment in the lobby ( guitar singer and piano w/ singer) McDonald's across the street for the kids and sky park next door walking distance
neg,If you ever book a room there  book one that facing Taal lake-floors 2 to 4.  Don't ever get the cheap room because it's like 2 floors downstairs like a parking garage. It's worth the extra peso to do that or you will be very unhappy
pos,I love the location of the hotel  especially the our room which is facing the task lake.
neg,Nothing
pos,Very good service !
neg,The Bathroom is old and dirty.
pos,Nice place and good foods
pos,The view from the lobby is pretty.

pos,Love the room  facilities  location of the hotel  employees and security.
neg,Room was hot
pos,Location Security View
neg,Nothing i could think of. Swimming pool maybe as  it is quite far  from the new wing.
pos,We have always been  eating at Taal Vista Hotel whenever somebody in the family celebrates a birthday. Our anniversary is a day before my son's birthday so we opted to stay for a night  in the hotel.. It was  more  relaxing to eat knowing you have a good hotel to stay on.
neg,kids stay free BUT they did not eat free. Breakfast buffet was also sub par  especially for 860 pesos a head.
pos,hotel had a good view of Taal volcano
neg,Service at the restaurant.
pos,location is just an hour-drive from our residence. staff/employees are very polite.
neg,The Sky Ranch - which resulted in  traffic along the national Highway.
pos,Easy booking... Friendly staff.
neg,The restroom  the toilet bowl should come with bidet.
pos,The renovations have transformed Taal Vista into a luxurious hotel. The gardens are well kept. The rooms are kept clean! The staff are friendly. The view deck is marvelous!
neg,Kids play area was closed for renovation
pos,Very relaxing view
neg,Broken aircon poor quality of bed.
pos,Crispy bacon at the breakfast buffet
pos,The scenery and the breakfast.
neg,No value for money  too steep for available comforts. Small swimming pool considering the number of # guests and rooms  games rooms badly maintained with badly maintained pool table and games..gym has no glasses for drinking water!?
pos,Good location  good view  great food options
neg,going in and out of my room  its kind of far  going outside to the stairs and in to elevator
pos,location of my room have excellent view!
neg,The room is so dirty and most of all our door & window is broken.
pos,the food is good  the place so relaxing.
neg,There was no floor mat for the bathroom and i would have liked fresh milk in the refrigerator i don't like creamers.
pos,Best view in the world. Very nice staff  let us return to our room to shower even after we had checked out. (Taal volcano trek it very hot and dusty)
neg,Expensive hotel without even bidet installed in their bathroom. During the two days stay. Breakfast is good but i have to take my own coffee. The waiters just ignores me ehen im calling them. For two straight days. I dnt know if they choose who they serve coz the table besides me was well served. :(
pos,The scenery  cozy feel of the room and hotel.
neg,Nothing significant.
pos,The food was great it is in a perfect position with tremendous views and the staff were excellent
neg,The room and beddings too simple as well as the CR. This is a 2 star hotel
pos,The view
pos,The room's view The ambiance of the room and everywhere The breakfast
pos,Great room  excellent view of the lake. Breakfast was superb.
pos,The price rate for this hotel is not worth it. Theres nothing wow in this hotel except for the view but the bed and room are too simple like a 2 star hote.  The check was lousy  took us 45 mins standing wating to be entertained.
neg,dirty room terrasse missing clean towels empty dishes in the corridor. dirty Kid's corner Queing for breakfast. tour organisation
pos,Yummy breakfast!
neg,-had to call and request for towels and toiletries because these were not provided in the room when we got there -aircon not too cold even if it's set to lowest temp
pos,view point Taza restaurant breakfast
neg,I have stayed in this hotel twice. The first time  in 2013  was in the Lake Wing. I remember there being a lot of noise from Sky Ranch Park  are really inconvenient path to our room through a ballroom and up a flight of stairs before reaching the elevator (this is important if you're traveling with people with disabilities)  and incredibly bad service.  Despite deciding at that point that I would not return to this hotel  I decided to give it another chance in early 2016  in the Mountain Wing.  This wing is considerably older than the Lake wing  and while generally clean and maintained  the quality of our room was underwhelming.  On top of this  a regular stream of noisy guests in the hallway kept us up from 11pm to 3am. As they loud guests were always different  it didn't appear that calling the front desk would reduce the problem. When complaining to the Manager in the morning  I was again underwhelmed by the customer service.
pos,The weather
neg,Towels does not look clean (off-white). this is not a five star hotel. very old facilities like shower  etc.
pos,Exceptional service from caf veranda staff
neg,hard pillows...  old hard towel... only one towel and no face towel
pos,The hotel terrace has an undeniably good view of Taal Lake.
neg,There wasn't anything to do  and the food was really disappointing
pos,The view and spa was amazing
neg,rooms especially at the mountain wing looks old already; needs renovation Sink is leaking; all maintenance can do is place a towel on the floor to avoid slippage
pos,Our room is nicely located to my preferred view. Staff is very accommodating. Facilities are very nice.
pos,very convenient location
neg,I didn't like the fact that it was a short stay for me. Haha.
pos,Everything was just perfect. A paradise treat really. Beautiful and relaxing. Had the best view as well. Very nice
neg,The room was not clean  tiles from floor are coming off
pos,wonderful experience
neg,No blanket under the duvet...its unsanitary..late checkin though we requested for early checki in..requested for a non smoking rooms but we landed in a smoking room
pos,Breakfast.
neg,My towel was mistaken as hotel towel and I found my towel dirty and wet on the floor.
pos,only the view of the room
neg,- room door paint are peeling off - floors are not clean - pillow covers are not white enough and stained  - bathroom tiles grout are not clean  - the smell of the room is moldy - I thought all their rooms has been renovated and turned to modern furnishings which shows in the picture - the rooms are not sound proof. you can hear the trolleys and kids in the hallway
pos,Location  room and room size
neg,nothing
pos,the service was excellent
neg,Aircon machine is not working well  kids on the other room are roaming around and very noisy
pos,Highly recommended
neg,Nothing
neg,We arrived at the hotel few minutes before 1pm. We were allowed to check in. After the SOP  for checking in  we were informed that we have to wait for a few more minutes since our room is still being prepared. We obliged as we understand that standard check in time is 2pm. After a few minutes  I checked with the front desk officer if the room is ready. I was informed that it is still being cleaned and will be finished at exactly 2pm. While we were sitted at the lobby  we noticed that some guests who have checked in were allowed to proceed to their rooms right away. So I approached the front desk officer again and told him that we noticed. I was in a different tone  when I aporoached him. I told him that we booked our room one month before and we are not walk in guests. Why do we still have to wait for 2pm while other guests are allowed to proceed to their room right after checking in. He went inside a room behind the front desk. When he returned  he told me that we can now proceed to our room. Initially he said that the room will be available at 2pm. But when I approached him in a different tone  he told me that the room is ready. He was apologetic but did not give any explanation to what happened. Also  we were not able to use their wifi because of poor signal. Tried to ask the staff one time and she just gave me a new password. I did not bother to insists on the wifi because of bad experience that we had checking in.
pos,The location and the big bed
neg,Delays at Check-in.  I have stayed at the hotel a few times and every time the check in has been slow and lacked courtesy. I have never felt any warmth or being welcome.
pos,The restaurants are good  especially Taza.
neg,The front desk were extremely inefficient. I had to transfer rooms because I asked to stay an extra night (I shouldn't have had to do that in the first place)  but I obliged because a guest was checking in and wanted 3 rooms next to each other (one of which was my room). But since I had to prepare for a wedding  I wanted to transfer early and was told I could transfer by 9AM). At 9  they sent a bellhop to get our things but he had no idea where we were transferring to. The front desk personnel who arranged the transfer went on break. No one could resolve the issue and we were transferred at 11:00! The wedding I had to prepare for and travel to was at 12NN.
pos,The bell hops and the guards were nice.
neg,I should have reserved a room with a view of the lake.
pos,Everything.
neg,None
pos,The location is fantastic. Hotel rooms are beautiful and the hotel staffs are nice and accomodating.
neg,Mostly everything  from the room  to the service   facilities needs alot of work and improvements. Not worth the money. I think too pricey for the condition of the rooms and facilities.rooms are so outdated.too much hidden fees.Staff are not so helpful  didnt notify customers if requests are available.Didnt like the hotel at all. Will not going to stay there ever again.
pos,Superb staff   awesome views   excellent food
neg,staff in the breakfast cafe are not as good. i fall in line for the breakfast but since the one behind me handed the stub first she was given seats first  so what is the line first huh? table cloth are not change after each use.
pos,Just the buffet breakfast
neg,Not value for money

neg,Wifi is terribly slow  was not able to check emails because of that. The bed is very uncomfortable  we can feel the mattress coil on our backs. We told the bellboy about it but nobody bothered to check. The waiters on the dining area are not very friendly and alert. We have to call their attention a couple of times before they will act.
pos,I like the location
neg,It took long time to check in.

neg,Air conditioner was leaking and the room was too warm.  We reported to front desk and they said they'd send someone to fix it.  It wasn't fixed and basically  the front desk person said there was nothing they could do because they couldn't transfer us to other rooms - the hotel was fully booked.  So we still paid the ridiculous price for a room that was uncomfortable and too warm.  They didn't do anything to at least address our complaint.  It was as if...too bad  you're-already-here-so-just bear-with-it kind of case.  The staff were obviously not trained to handle a simple case such as this.  No warmth  no empathy...robotic kind of service. To further validate that we made the wrong choice of staying in this hotel....during breakfast  one of the staff was insisting that my son  9 years old  was an adult.  So I told her to go ahead and interview him herself  and ask for his birth date and whatever qualifying questions she had in mind.  Disappointing.  Assuming that we probably just want to pay half the price of the buffet so we were saying he was below 11.  Annoying....especially when we slept in an uncomfortable state given that the hotel's air conditioner was busted!  Then you see the buffet table fruit selection covered with fruit flies.  Hope this comment reaches the hotel's management team....because obviously...from facilities to staff...you need a total revamp.
pos,Their front office are very accomodating esp the one named Denise. She always make sure that everything is okay. The food in Cafe Veranda is very very tasty you'll enjoy every bite. And also the location of the hotel  the view of taal lake is very awesome unlike any other hotels.
neg,I don't have a bad experience but since I worked in a 5 star hotel before I notice that the tissue in the bathroom is not new bec it is already thin.
pos,the ambiance is good very accomodating staff overall Good
pos,ambience and courteous staff and delicious food
neg,The Mountain Wing room I was in was old. The screen sliding door to the patio kept coming off the rail and I had to fix it every time we went in and out (We hung out in the patio a lot). The coffee maker still had water (probably) from the previous guest. The rubber slip mat in the bathtub was visibly old and should be replaced. Lastly  I was not given a choice to choose a room in the newer and better Lake Wing (where I had previously stayed and was very satisfied) when I booked online.
pos,The staff were very accommodating and acted quickly  even way past midnight.
neg,CR inside room no bedi & also bad smell
pos,The view
neg,Unexpected  undeclared 2 000 deposit upon check in
pos,Very comfortable and really met out expectations.
neg,No bidet.
neg,Internet access was very slow.
pos,The room was very spacious and clean. The view from the room facing taal lake was something to look forward to everyday.
neg,It rained and the porch was slippery ; the buffet per person rate was pricey.
pos,The room is very clean and comfortable  separate toilet and bathroom  variety of buffet food selection  fresh garden salad  pineapple salad dressing and  fruits made me feel i was truly in Tagaytay City;  the best though is the great view of the Taal Volcano;
neg,Difficult to walk around for elderly guests  lack of elevators/very far from lobby. Some leaking roofs at lobby  breakfast hall. Lack of activities and spaces for kids within the hotel compound in relation to the volume of guests.
pos,Bed was comfy. Kind staff. Proximity to nearby activities/places of interest. Delicious baked goods. Nice historical pictures along the walls-but should probably be displayed more prominently.
neg,some lights not properly working and CR door lock not working
pos,accommodating staff
neg,Rooms far from restaurant for senior & pwd

pos,The location
neg,Breakfast was awful. They said they were going to give complimentary anniversary cake but nothing ever came even if we followed it up.  Asmara spa was excellent.
pos,The room
neg,It would be better to have more reservations officer at the front desk during peak hours (check in and check out times  weekends/holidays) so as to lessen the slow que of people falling in line.
pos,I highly recommend the lake wing rooms. I enjoyed the veranda breakfast buffet.
neg,No bidet
pos,Lake view
neg,Shower overflowed to the hallway.
pos,Bed was very comfortable
neg,Paint and water stains on balcony ceiling
pos,Staff Hospitality
neg,1) The air-conditioning unit in our room leaked during the first night  and maintenance spent around 20 minutes in the room cleaning/ fixing the unit. 2) The shower/ tub drain might've been clogged as shower water drained very very slowly (we actually thought that the stopper was already placed in the drain). 3) Called concierge/ front desk two times (varying times) and nobody answered. 4) The in-room dining menu placed in our room was not updated. 5) SLOW internet connection
pos,1) Super comfortable bed 2) Clean and spacious room 3) Clean and spacious bathroom 4) Clean and accessible swimming pool 5) Very delicious food! (standard breakfast fare- but so yummy!  and excellent in-room dining selections- we ordered from room service on both nights!)
neg,Room outdated  staff passing through the hallway made loud squeaking noise that startled me at 5 am   talking loudly not taking in consideration that guests are sleeping.
pos,Comfortable
neg,None
pos,The staffs are very friendly and accomodating!thumbs up !
neg,No bidet in the restroom  Restroom can still be improved.
pos,Its very clean. Staff are so respectful and hospitable.
neg,AC is not working properly  techinician came but the temperature didn't changed. We slept with our sweat 
pos,Bed was excellent  view was breathtaking and buffet was really delicious!
neg,Breakfast need improvement.
pos,Food  comfyness of the bed and the view
neg,Bathroom is so unclean
pos,Always nice but Agoda have to be clear as the lake side room that I have do not face the Taal lake.
neg,rooms are a bit rundown
pos,The location
pos,view of Taal Lake  buffet breakfast spread
neg,Accessibility of Hotel Facilities like Pools and Kids Room  from our Room is very far.
pos,Luxurious and Relaxing. Nice View of Taal Lake.
neg,Noise  people talking in the hallway.
pos,I like the friendly staff; ready to assist us when we need them.
neg,Long walk to our room from the hotel lobby.
pos,Good Accessibility to Skyranch  presence of a play area for kids  buffet breakfast was very good  staff are very warmth and accommodating.
neg,Buffet is only standard  no cold beers.
pos,Location  view of Taal  confortable rooms with enough space.
neg,The mini bar was locked.
pos,Buffet
neg,I feel the place needs renovation.
pos,The location and view.
neg,Backyard room view (I thought Lake Wing meant lake view for a deluxe suite). Sound proofing of the rooms from noisy neighbors can benefit from improvement.
pos,Great breakfast food selection  good acoustic entertainment at the lobby
neg,the aircon in our room is not as cold as we wanted it
pos,the location and the view
neg,The water from the bathroom had to be wiped twice by the housekeeper because it flown from inside going to the foyer of the room.
neg,Water heater in the room was not fixed
pos,Breakfast buffet was good!
neg,We booked 7 rooms  none had the requested lake view.  We asked to have a baby cot also not provided. Showers are too old.
pos,Bed linen
neg,The stream of water from the shower was so weak it was not possible to take a bath properly. The towels were also old  gray and thin.
pos,Location.
neg,Filipino-Breakfast: Not for everyone Poor cleanliness of room and bathroom
pos,Julian at the reception was beyond helpful and anticipated my needs. Offered to have our breakfast packed since we were leaving early the following day.  Coconut bread at the bakeshop was delicious. Breakfast buffet selection was more than average and delicious.The soup was a bit salty though. The view of course is what made me choose to stay here.
neg,Service was super slow.  They were nice but they took at least 15 minutes to get a glass of water or utensils even if there were only a few customers.  We stayed here for three days and all staff were not prompt with request.
pos,The view is amazing plus the staff were very friendly - all of them!
neg,Food
pos,Breathtaking view from veranda  approachable staff
neg,People occupying the front tables of the lobby cafe for hours  blocking the view  not talking to each other  way done eating  just browsing with their phones.
neg,The A/C in our room was dripping  which isn't safe at all.
neg,I tried to withdraw money in the atm at the hotel and my card got captured when I inserted it into the machine. I didn't even get to punch in my pin yet! It took some time before the hotel personnel contacted the bank and I was told to have my card blocked and get another card from my bank when I get home. It's a good thing I have another atm card from another bank or I would have had no money during my stay in Tagaytay!
neg,Housekeeping forgot to place garbage bag to bin  and forgot to dispose some trash leaving it to the bathroom
neg,They are missing the magnifying mirror in the bathroom. Also missing a flush for the toilet. The TV size is small for the suite  it needs a min of 42 TV. The swimming pool is small for the size of the hotel & it looks like it is for kids! I did not like that I had to reissue my reservation again with a higher price because they claim the they sent me an email that my credit card did not work  although it worked the 2nd time with the higher price!!!!
pos,Suite is comfortable. The view of the lake is so amazing. The food is good although they only have one restaurant & one caf. TV channel is fare. Bed is comfortable to sleep. The balcony is nice to sit & enjoy the view. Bathroom size is big & comfortable.
neg,Since our room had a connecting door we could hearbtge coughing and shouting of our neighbor
pos,Bfast was worth it
neg,I wish they have other activities to do inside the hotel aside from the pool and the NOT so much of an activity room.
pos,the MASSAGE!!!.. =)
neg,Aircon leaked.
pos,The facilities.
neg,Wifi not the most easy to access and lost signal a lot of time. For expensive room (Lake view   aroud 170 euro at night) dinner should be included at the minimum (or a voucher/discount ticket ) .
pos,Very accommodating and friendly staff
neg,Check in process was slow. Wile it is on a holiday weekend  I still think standing in line for almost an hour is too much.
pos,Amazing Place and view (maybe the best one)  very big and with a lot of entertainment.
neg,Nothing
pos,The buffet breakfast is great. View of Taal volcano is great
neg,There's no bidet
pos,Everything specially the staff who are so friendly and accommodating
neg,Install bedet for toilet.
pos,Size of rooms and claenliness
pos,Room is spacey
neg,We were placed in a room with only a partial view of the lake when i booked a Lake View Room..after requesting for a room transfer  we were transferred to a smoking room which was the downside of the whole stay..could have been perfect if we were given exactly the room for the price that I paid for
pos,Breakfast selection was great. Service was on point and accommodations were nice.
neg,One thing to improve. I didn't care for bathrooms since they looked more like public restrooms with a glass door that doesn't have privacy.
pos,We loved the breakfast. The bacons were so yuuum! The rooms and the view are excellent.
neg,The staff can be a little bit more accommodating. There are some stuff that are friendly tho.
pos,The view of Taal never fails to overwhelm. The service is good.Food from the breakfast buffet could still be improved.
neg,The shower curtain had a nasty smell. There was also an unpleasant smell coming from the drain.
pos,Great view of the Taal volcano from our room
neg,Walls seemed very solid  but weird we were heard noises in the middle of the night.  Contacted the front desk about it  but they said it could be from a TV from another room.  Very strange...
pos,The food  the room and all the staff.
neg,Choices of food in the breakfast buffet.
pos,The hotel has a spectacular view of Taal Lake. It's a huge hotel with complete facilities.
neg,Staff can be more friendly and accomodating. Facilities are a bit outdated considering the room charge/night.
pos,Breakfast buffet
neg,No bidet in the toilet.
pos,The view was nice. Room was comfortable.
pos,very nice view of taal and yummy breakfast
neg,- Facilities and Furniture are quite old. Can probably use remodeling or upgrades
pos,The service and food is good. The hotel is nearer to the place where we attended wedding.
neg,During check in  there was still a wait for the room to become available
pos,- Asmara Spa in Taal Vista; Masseurs were very good - Staff were attentive and courteous - One of the best views in Tagaytay
neg,The food! Not really good! The value of money for buffets are not reasonable.
pos,The location and the food
neg,The washroom didnt have any door and no bath tub
pos,The view!
neg,The room was not ready so we wait for 1 hour.
pos,The location
neg,The food in the veranda for the ala carte menu is not to up to par.  The crispy liempo is OVER FRIED.  The bulalo did not do justice.   We know how it should taste!  The servings and portions are too small.  Try to come up with group meals.
pos,I like the room breakfast and view of taal lake.
neg,The facilities were tired and checking in and finding a suitable room was arduous. Also issues included: Flickering light  noisy rooms  untidy finishes  electricity sounds  fairground noise next door  phone not working  no phone on floor to call reception if needed  rooms very far from reception.
pos,Complimentary Wine and Cake for our Honeymoon  Lake view as well
neg,The bathroom is not very clean. The shower not functioning very well. They need to renovate
pos,I like the size of the room and the bathroom.  It has enough space for me to move around.  I like that they have a clothes line inside the bathroom.  The design of the bathroom makes it easier for us to keep it dry.  This is a classic hotel that could last for decades because it placed priority on the needs of the guests OVER THE  AESTHETICS.  Never mind if it is not trendy or modern BUT it kept the guests' needs first!
pos,The staff were very pleasant and friendly.
pos,I like the location and the staff. They are very helpful and courteous
neg,Room is old  limitted food choices  and noise in other rooms and from the outside is loud  not much of sound proofing.
pos,The view at the view deck.
neg,No wifi at room 124.
pos,Big thanks to Erika who assisted me at the reception. She offered me a room upgrade which is cheaper than having an extra bed. Others didn't offer it when my husband first inquired. 2kplus pesos is a difference huh. Big thanks to Erika 
neg,Costly amount of food 
pos,Overall service is excellent.
neg,No bidet. Leaking aircon. Water coming out of shower cubicle. Breakfast was delicious but they have the same menu everyday.
pos,Fast wifi
neg,but the service elsewehere in the hotel  the noise levels  the cleanliness of the room with bugs etc was not great especially for the $ spent on the same
pos,The view is fascinating. It is great to watch the iew of taal.lake
neg,i did not like the buffet breakfast - very few choices and taste was bland; I also did not like the way they managed and served the breakfast in the function room; there was only 2 to 3 personnel attending to a hundred guests having breakfast; most of the food bins were almost empty when there was still a long queue of guests who were not having breakfast; we waited for 15 minutes before we were able to get a seat.
pos,the restaurant  not buffet was incredible and the staff very lovely
neg,Old rooms and facility
pos,They provide very good assistance particularly to the elderly.
neg,The room was less than what i was expecting for the price its hard to tell from the ads what you'll get.there was drilling and hammering around 1030-11am that can be heard from the room  as if it was being done in the room. Some traffic noise and screams from sky ranch can be heard from the room.
pos,i like the view
pos,Great view outside overlooking taal volcano (not from the room).good breakfast.tolerable wifi.convenient entrance to sky ranch at the back of the property i wish the staff told me about it after buying tickets from them so i didnt have to walk through the busy highway's narrow sidewalk with little kids.
neg,I requested an extra bed before we arrived  wasn't provided one. I followed it up the day we arrived  receptionist said will speak with housekeeping. Still no extra bed  and I was still charged for it!  Plus charges should be incurred upon booking  so people would know the ACTUAL price before booking. Plus  housekeeping was changing our linen while we were in the room. That is a first for me in all of the hotels we've booked before. Lastly  only one keycard was provided for us  I still have to request for a spare.
pos,Good size bedroom
neg,Too many bedrooms and not enough restaurant capacity to sit everyone. People made to queue and wait for breakfast  not enough waiting staff. Traffic in Tagaytay is now worse than Manila
pos,the staff  particularly the waiters at the veranda were all nice...i love the cookies given for new year...
neg,there was no receipt issued to me even if i asked for it already...i asked for an extra bed for so many times  and i ended up none... it was raining during that time  and part of the ceiling  maybe near  the window has a leakage  we reported it already  but still no action... the floor should have been carpeted nowadays...
pos,Nothing  if other hotels are available I won't stay there.
neg,Bugs in the room  smelly shower curtains and shower mat  old towels and bedding.
pos,We got the booking for its location. The front desk staff are attentive to our needs during check in and check out.
neg,Hotel needs major uplift  escalator out of order  they gave us a room in d old wing. Hot water for shower not hot enough. Lack of drinking glasses in d bedroom. Moldy smelling room.
pos,Friendly staff  great view  breakfast buffet  cleanliness  courteous and reliable staff. VALUE FOR MONEY! AWESOME
neg,We were expecting for a good view  but we were given a room with a view of the rooftop and windows of the other rooms.  There was no bidet in the toilet and the way the toilet was designed  there was no door towards the inner room going to the shower area and the toilet room.  That's why the smell from the toilet comes out into the whole room. The aircon was leaking  but was eventually repaired when we called the front desk.  We asked for ice and some other requests but until we checked out  our requests were not attended to.
pos,Staff were very friendly. View is nice.
neg,Expected more for price and rating.  Noisy hotel  can hear everything from guests in other rooms  slamming of doors. Long walks to rooms  smell and feeling is a bit like a hospital! Food quality average  fast food style. Seevice slow and staff needed reminding that youd ordered. Breakfast choice poor  fried  unhealthy. Coffee is poor. In our opinion price  is not reasonable for old style hotel that needs renovating - similar price to 5 star hotel in Manila but quality average.
pos,View was good
neg,A bit expensive for the whole experience
neg,first and formost when i book my stay here i confirmed a cash basis pay but to my surprise when we get there its already paid via my credit card!! how come would you settle my bill at my credit card without informing me???!! the aircon in our room is not functioning! i call for check up  the engineer or the maintenance also feel the hotness in our room but they still say the aircon has no problem at all  and to think they just offer me a fan! i was like?! really??? at taal vista hotel i would use a fan!! lastly  why dont you have  a sign board or precaution sign telling that if its raining the grass is very slippery. my mom stamble down!! and infairness to your security or even a staff NO ONE HANDED FOR A HELP!! when i get back to check my parents  thats the only time we call for house doctor and when they ask the security they didnt know that happen!!!
neg,We found the room facilities to be very dated and old. Granted  it's an old hotel but a lot of their fixtures (and floors) need to be updated. We got a mountain view room and it wasn't so much a view of a mountain but more a view of the neighboring empty lot. One would expect more for the price you have to pay for the room  It was 5 200 plus in Booking.com but amounted to 6 500 when we got there (Plus there was a 2k deposit).
pos,We like how abundant the breakfast buffet was  and the staff were very accommodating and friendly.
neg,The furnishings in the premier/lake view rooms could use some updating though.
pos,Taal vista is the place to be when staying with family.  We grew up to this hotel and brings back a lot of good memories.
neg,It is most unfortunate that the front desk staff did not inform us that we were entitled to a discount - we are SM Advantage cardholders.  As a result  we were made to pay P 1 500.00 more.  Not good.
pos,This may be the best hotel in Tagaytay City insofar as location and as facilities are concerned.
neg,Bath tub was not clean  bath tub and bathroom sink were clogged  Bed was not that comfortable  Cable was not working
pos,Very thorough and friendly
neg,Old facilities. The mattress and pillows were hard. It was an uncomfortable 3-night-sleep. I didn't expect for a 5-star hotel to have those kind of mattress pillows. 3-star hotels in Makati are even better.   Even worse...the electrical sockets available are type A sockets only. Luckily there was usb port in their LCD tv and I managed to charged my phone. But really disappointed  the rest of my devices weren't charged because all of my chargers are type E.  Disappointed also with the view from our room. I got the mountain view. It was not worth the money.
pos,Good location and Sunday mass was held at the hotel
pos,The view from the restaurant towards the lake is breathtaking. Friendly staff.
pos,It was during the time when you have to wake up in the morning and rest in the afternoon when the sounds of hammer and grillings came. Didnt get enough rest but the place is so awesome.
neg,I always book through agoda and is aleaysbhassle free. But this time we werent told that we have to pay extra Php3000 at the hotel for reservation fee. What if we only had exact money as was told at the checkout? Just wish the instruction and payment are clear.
pos,Enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Will definitely comeback and this time with my kids.
pos,Beautiful tagaytay scenery great view this hotel and nice swimming pool big clean room.
pos,Enjoyed our stay relaxing place with a view  excellent friendly staff in restaurant  just the traffic to go and back   it took 5 hours to get back home . Oh well traffic in Philippines
pos,One of the best hotel in Tagaytay. Awesome views of Taal.
pos,I will visit this Hotel soon... Very much recommended..
pos,Food has greatly improved in terms of taste and portioning.
neg,The amount of money I paid to the room we have chosen is not worth it  the room required refurbishment  10 000 php for a deluxe room in taal vista is not worth it compare to estancia tagaytay which I visited last year for the rooms I would recommend estancia but for the food taal vista is much better this is the only good part of staying in taal vista  the ammenities are very poor especially the kids room and gym really require a renovation should the management initiate in urgent basis.
neg,Stayed here last September 23-24 2017 with my girlfriend. We were celebrating our 10th year anniversary. With this  we were expecting a lot from this hotel given that this is one of the pioneer and high end hotels in Tagaytay. 1. We were booked at room 434 Mountain Wing. 2. The check in process took some time (around 10-15 min) since there were a lot of guests checking in/out during that time. This is totally understandable given this period. 3. We were given a room even before the check in time. We thought that it would be a perfect stay since we got lucky to get a room ahead. 4. As for the room  these are our observations and experiences: a) The room is quite old and not well maintained. b) The furniture like drawers are old and dirty. c) The cabinet where the refrigerator is stored was already broken. When I opened it  the door suddenly fell. d) The cabinet is very dirty. It is quite unhygienic to store your food/drinks here since it is dirty/dusty. e) The bar (refrigerator) is empty. Well  maybe because the cabinet is dirty so they didn't bother to place drinks inside the ref. f) Poor stability of the bed. When I sat down on the edge of the bed to remove my shoes  I thought the mattress will flip over. g) The room is not carpeted. h) They forgot to place fresh bathroom towels and robes. We needed to request this from the housekeeping. I'm not in a hospitality business or whatever but I'm pretty sure that this a standard protocol when new guests will use a hotel room. i) The bathroom is spacious but it is very evident that it is not well maintained. The tiles were shaking (loose) when you step on it. Plus  the pressure of the bidet was too strong. Not sure if this was adjustable since I tried rotating the valve but it was super tight. j) The curtains were torn and looks very old and overused. k) Saw a dead cockroach at the lobby of Mountain Wing. l) The blower where not functioning properly when my gf used it. Also  the vanity mirror was not well lit. m)
neg,The lady receptionist told my wife that the room we booked was unavailable and offered other rooms but we had to pay additional fee. When I approached my wife and the receptionist and was told about this  I complained why the room that had already been booked could be unavailable. When the receptionist saw that I was not going to allow this to happen  she told us that she would try to talk to manager at the back. After a minute  she came back and said that they would just upgrade our room for free. But this incident left a bad taste in the mouth.
pos,Very freindly staff and a lot varient food especial in bfast buffet and so neat the hotel but not so around in facilities because got typhoon
neg,We selected this hotel solely on it's view and location. The staff was friendly enough. But the room was outdated and the shower/tub was terrible  very difficult to stand up. I would only stay here again based on the view alone.
pos,We enjoy our stay... place is beautiful  food is good and good location.
neg,Lovely hotel with a well trained staff to serve you and meet every need. Room was clean and bed was comfortable. We were disappointed that the equipment in the Fitness Center needed repairs (weight resistant machine  treadmill). We enjoy beginning the day with exercise but the Fitness Center is in need of attention. I could not get the A/C to work so it was hot and humid. Breakfast buffet was excellent. The lady chef cooks a really great omelette.
pos,Great helpful staff  even greater location. I prefer staying in the new wing as the old wing needs some renovation. Good buffet.
neg,we took the presidential suite but the hotel failed our expectation. checking inn was horrible and they did not even brought us to our room but instead the cleaner guided us. the bathroom needs refurbishing. the breakfast should be served since it is the presidential suite.. you still need to pay 150 pesos for the valet and queque just to pay it. the breakfast serving is horrible.  agoda charge us 497 dollars but the hotel charge us 30 thousand pesos and thats 100 dollars discrepancy. its just that we took the presidential suite and we also expect VIP treatment. the hotel is in prime location but the service is disgusting and so poor..
pos,The view of Taal Lake was amazing from the balcony of our room and definitely worth it!
neg,We did not have good dining experience  breakfast was ok  evening meal buffet is not good value and Al-a Carte was dismal  we went to Mcdonald`s across the road for our 2nd evening.
pos,Great view of Taal lake from the room. Great food. The couch from our room has stains already and personally it's due for a new one as it is afterall a luxury hotel. But overall stay was great. We've always love Taal Vista
pos,nice view. yummy food  good and kind service
neg,Disappointing of staff serving for some assist
pos,"I think that it is TOP Class in the Philippine level. Shower A lot of hot water, comfortable. We also had many kinds of breakfast buffet. The scenery of Lake Tar seen from the hotel is also superb."
neg,Been a Taal Vista regular for years now. However  last visit was disappointing. Made arrangements for a simple birthday surprise as I did before  but it seems like they no longer care  unlike previous years. Add to that  upon checking in our room - not the usual impressed and wow feeling...no bed runner  no throw pillows  Welcome note and goodies (usually fruits or pastries) the bathroom still had splatters on the glass  grout on the bathroom floors are visibly dirty  and into night - the aircon had a leak. Still gave it a shot for dinner  went to try the dinner buffet  but the selection was quite limited. I love Taal Vista - proposed to my wife there  also stayed there for our wedding  but maintenance and upkeep of the place has to step up. It's in the details  I guess. A great hotel experience goes down to the smallest of details. Time to explore the new options in Tagaytay. To the Management  please save Taal Vista  too many memories :(
pos,Buffet breakfast selection was great  so many choices. Great staff from front desk to room attendants. Will definitely book again here!
neg,We stayed at the old bldg. Yes  it's old.
pos,It had a nice getaway at Taal Vista with a spacious and comfortable room. The view was awesome! I booked the Premiere Lake View room. It was really nice that I can stay in my room the whole day.
neg,The hotel had a good location. Very near attractions and restaurants and also some parts were just newly renovated. I hope they could also renovate the rooms bec it's starting to look and feel old. The sliding door to the washroom doesn't work properly. The rooms at the mountain side needs renovation.
pos,Food looks good but taste is mediocre.
pos,good hotel  but still have room for improvement.
pos,excellent view of the lake. good buffet selection during breakfast.
pos,We stayed on the lake wing  premier king. The room is clean  thee bed is comfortable  the best part of staying here is the view from our room is superb. Their is a garden right below the veranda of the room  that when you open the door what you can here is the peaceful sound of the birds. We stayed here before on a weekend  and our recent stay was on a midweek. You can enjoy more the place during midweek because they have less guest  I mean  you can enjoy more roaming around and use their pool more  check in or out more faster. But  if you'll be staying here on a weekend  their breakfast has wider selection than what they do offer during midweek. Parking is free  another thumbs up. The only downside I got same as my previous stay was their bathroom has no bidet. They even just have the shower head on the top of the bath tub   they don't have the movable shower. I rated 3* 4* their cleanliness and facilities because the sofa inside our room has stains and a little ruin  probably because of its beige color  I even had a doubt at first if will seat or not. lol Overall  our stay was pleasant.
pos,Although we had issues during check in and there was no view from our room  our stay became memorable. It was a great venue for celebrating a wedding and at the same time family reunion. I appreciated the room attendant who cleaned our room  the guard who watched over us in the pool. and people serving at the buffet breakfast.
pos,generally the hotel renovation is old but with good facilities and nice view
pos,Truly relaxing place near the city.
pos,It's the lake view that stood out the most and breakfast is awesome even though price is still higher than the usual hotel staycation promo rates in Manila.
pos,A place to stay if you're a family with little ones. Best location. Kindda outdated but it does not matter as the location is superb. Great view of Taal volcano.
pos,Really the place  nature and nice facilities and can not forget the kindness of their staff 
pos,Great place to relax and recuperate from busy lifestyle
neg,Has faulty A/C The bed is hard - not comfortable for sleeping Stains on the floor
neg,Everything was great except for aircon room not cold enough..and i notice the tv room got lines already need replacement?although not too significant coz u wont stay in the room for too long to watch tv!
pos,Booked this for my folks as their wedding anniversary gift and they enjoyed it.
pos,The location gives you the best view of taal but we're just caught off guard that we had to pay more if we want the lake view room. We just thought they are a bit pricey  when we can just eat in their restaurant and enjoy the view for a couple of hours.
pos,Celebrated Father's Day with our children. The staff are kind enough to let us check in earlier  we also got a complimentary merienda during our stay
pos,We do enjoyed our stay ..
neg,the service was no good  lost the baggage the first day  no water in the room  needed to wait a lot for breakfast  so price/quality no good
pos,a very nice hotel with amazing views. hotel staffs were very friendly. location was right beside sky ranch. a very awesome hotel and will return again.
pos,Still needed some little make-overs  but the name TAAL VISTA HOTEL remains. Worth our trip!
pos,Please maintain the beautiful exterior of it. I know it's hard to maintain it in the Philippines with the humid and dusty weather. But please put a lot of effort into it. Love the hotel  the food  the staff! Will definitely come back!
pos,Duty Manager (Akin) was very helpful. I hope I spelled your name right. Food at Veranda restaurant (a la carte) is excellent! Magnificent view. Joy from the Spa was great!
pos,We got the Superior King accommodation (Room 420) for half the price of it. Clean room and love the classic interior. CR lock is the only off thing during our stay.
pos,the hotel location is perfect. i love the breakfast. facilities are good but not perfect.
pos,Nice view  nice room in lake wing  nice spa  free big parking for hotel guest. Everything is good except the very small swimming pool and overloaded all day dining restaurant.
pos,Enjoy the stay
neg,Stayed at their mountain wing. Room size was okay with 2 twin beds and a day bed. Disappointed though with their bathroom. Toilet seat cover is broken or not attached properly. Bathroom fixtures are old and needs replacement - faucet can't be closed properly - water was dripping. No hot water available in our shower on the first night. I hope they renovate the mountain wing soon. The Lake wing looks really nice.
pos,Taal vista Hotel is a top choice in tagaytay and will likely remain so for years to come because it balances location  view  spacious design and history with an acceptable price. Though it has to deal with getting older and of need of possible renovations  my family and I like very much the overall feel of what we get and what we expect from a 4-5 star provincial hotel. We will definitely come back and look forward to a longer stay here.
pos,Everyone I deal with were very accomadating and the young lady at the register upgrade my room from mountain view to a lake View! with no xtra charge which was more than expected!! if I ever decided to come back to Manila I would go back there and stay for a week instead of 3 nights!!
pos,been there so many times. I like the location. A quiet and peaceful surroundings  although the rooms in the mounain wing side are a bit old  still fit to stay with.
neg,The room was old and very far by walk from the reception area.
pos,Nice view and staff are friendly
pos,Despite the long line during check in and out. I was surprise that it only took us around 10mins  also baggage was delivered instantly as soon as we got in to our room. The room was big enough for 2 adults and 3 kids but not meticulously cleaned (flies in the room). It was walking distance to sky ranch which was really favorable for us since we are traveling with r kids 11  3 and 2 yo. We tried going to the game room but unfortunately all the board games and chess board which was indicated in the list was unavailable.We also checked out the play are for small kids but TV wasnt working so you couldnt play with the Xbox. All in all our stay here was average. With the amount we paid I'm sure will be getting better deals somewhere else.
pos,We had a wonderful overnight stay at the Hotel. Great view and very helpful staff members. Though we had an issue on the door lock of one of our rooms  the staff and mamager was able to fix it ASAP. Check-in and check-out was a a breeze. Ample parking space as well.
pos,The facilities are good particularly the buffet meals. The staff was not particular to the request of the guests. We were inquiring for the dinner and was advised that they will call us regarding the inquiry but we didnt receive any call.. Apparently the staff forgot about it.
neg,Restaurant and hotel like a tomb with nobody to be seen  could not believe i could not buy/upgrade to a view even for $$ with only 60% capacity. Cold shower  faulty TV  no internet  view of concrete. Paid the kings ransom to eat in restaurant buffet  which is fantastic  but that's the only positive. Stayed there many times before  but won't be back again after this last effort.
neg,Just a bit chaos on breakfast coz @ around 9am we were still on a waiting list  anyway patience is a virtue!
neg,Rooms and bathroom dirty. Floor sticky. Air con not working properly.
pos,It's a great family hotel. Breakfast was good! The lounge was good! Excellent views! Room is old fashioned but very clean and tidy. It worked well for me. Will come for sure!
pos,I may say  this is a nice hotel not fancy though. With a class  that's it.
pos,We had the lake wing with balcony and was perfect. Room was large with coffee maker  ice box   iron/ board and all the necessary ammenities.
pos,The juices were made of syrup rather than fresh. This being Tagaytay  the Pineapple Juice should be at least fresh. Still  a good experience.
neg,Kindly give first to participants of the conferences the rooms near function rooms. We were given a room (rm148) just beside the hall where they dine and smoke. We cant stay on the balcony coz of the noise and smoke.
pos,would be nice if there was a bigger swimming pool  view is breath-taking  sprawling grass and breakfast buffet are awesome! thank you!
neg,Stayed in mountain wing  room is showing its age. Need more maintenance. Balcony light not working  safe box not working  bed is sinking  hot water pressure is poor. The good are the staff and decent breakfast. But for the price paid not so value for money.
neg,The buffet breakfast had only few choices of food  we were surprised with so many peiple eating and high class hotel you can count how many food they serve on breakfast not so much choices not worth the money
pos,Value for Money! We had a great time! Thank you!
pos,Happy with the service when checking in and out.very orderly. Even if i booked it via online.i didnt even presented a printed confirmation or i didnt even showed my phone fr the confirmation. Just a valid id. the breakfast is so good. I hope to come back soon.
pos,Beautiful location  very good breakfast. Helpful staff
pos,I booked here and make a note that me and my wife will celebrate our 2nd anniversary with my 10months old baby. And what a surprise we have a welcome cake in our room with a beautiful view. But the beds are two single. I asked the bell boy if we can transfer to a room with king size bed 'coz we are family and we can't sleep in separate beds. And after a few minutes the bell boy assisted us to transfer to a new room.and it was great because the room is huge for the 3 of us. All the staffs are kind and joyful as they are always greeting and smiling wherever we saw them. The food is great as its buffet breakfast. I love the coffee(kapeng barako)which is very famous in Town.
pos,The staff are the best! Accommodating to my every request :)
pos,Location is perfectly infront of the volcano abd center of Tagaytay
pos,location is best  food was okay hotel is okay need to update
pos,I thank Kevina from the reception staff
pos,Taal Vista Hotel has always been our go to hotel when we stay in Tagaytay to enjoy the breezy weather. Will visit again soon.
pos,Cool place to beat the hot weather.
pos,big rooms  friendly staff  great breakfast
pos,I was offered a room upgrade for an additional 500 pesos. They said it has a view of the lake but I was placed in a room facing the road. I didn't complain because I just had to walk over to the other side to see the view. Besides it was a bigger room. What I didn't realize was how the vehicles speeding the highway in the wee hours  would disrupt my sleep. There weren't too many (maybe 3x)  but enough to wake me up. Loved the buffet breakfast though.
neg,too expensive for the experience
pos,good
pos,The best hotel !
neg,This is a vacation place for the local. There's a theme park and a small mall right next to the hotel. Stayed there for a seminar so had all my meals in the hotel. Food is good. Nice view from the room. Hotel property is big and not tall so need to walk a bit to the rooms. You will need a car or have to take a cab wherever you go. No public transport available at the hotel.
neg,not worth the money. so expensive for a very outdated rooms and facilities. Many other new and more beautiful nearby.
neg,The location could not have been better in Tagaytay- a short drive from many attractions  and the view was spectacular. The Lake Wing especially has incredible views. The Mountain Wing is pretty run down and poorly maintained  which was quite disappointing.
pos,staff was nice. great view.
pos,Stayed here twice already! Good accommodations and prime location :) will recommend!
pos,Pro: The quality of breakfast is awesome  got a lot of food variety and the taste is great. Con: Rooms need renovation. The bed-sheets and carpet looked dirty.
pos,Good use of signage. But more on upgrading furnishings.
pos,Great hotel. As always. Breakfast buffet is still great but I loved the choices before Caf Veranda was renovated better.
neg,hotel is a bit old but staff are all corteous. needs renovation
pos,New hotels have lower prices
pos,The place is perfect if you choose the Lake View. Easy to find because it's located along the major road in Tagaytay. The hotel is good  but may need a little renovation. The staff is really helpful and polite.
neg,Pros- cool weather  place near every must-go places in Tagaytay   taal lake view  friendly staff  clean place  view at the mountain wing Cons- room's a bit old and not sound proof-you'll hear the noise from the hallway   pool not heated-my kid loves swimming but unable to swim because of the cool weather  Veranda always full during breakfast but good thing they have other rooms available like the lounge and at the Taza resto
pos,Taal Vista Hotel is my go-to hotel whenever I'm in Tagaytay. I have never been disappointed with the amenities or the staff.
neg,Shower head not quite ok. Rusty and worn out. Facilities quite not ok. Bfast buffet were less compared in previous years.
pos,Hotel come with perfect view. Nice to stay for holidays.
pos,The room they gave us upon check in was not what I expected. I reserved and paid for a room that's premium with a full mountain view. They gave us a room in the basement of their old wing. It was very gloomy  not a full mountain view at all  quite far from their facilities & not accesible to any lift. After speaking to their manager on duty  she was very professional  accomodating and transfered us a much better room. We appreciated the gesture. In my opinion  they need to review their coffee shop & room service menu. It's boring and can be improved to match their 4 star hotel category.
pos,i visited with my big family. It was completed facility and was comfortable to stay. i will visit again.
pos,enjoyed it
pos,weekend getaway
pos,The view is really nice
neg,Did not accommodate us by staff
pos,there is no cons  all pros! hotel room is good. buffet breakfast is more than ok. the location is near to all the attractions. service is wonderful. I specifically enjoy the pool and the gym.
neg,Room was not worth the price. We were booked in the last and farthest room of the hotel. The room was quite old but it was big enough for two person. Breakfast was fantastic  Lots of variation and food choices..
pos,Great place to relax and unwind with the family. View is amazing. Checking in was also a breeze. Really appreciated the new look of the Cafe Veranda. Food is great.
pos,Elevator is not working when we arrived. Have walk around the building and use the stairs just to go to our room. Great Dinner but forgettable breakfast.
pos,Smile
pos,Good location to enjoy the burkano view and the lake with big park
pos,Friendly staff  we are entertained by the trio guitarist during our dinner
neg,It would have been a great stay  if not for the issues with my card charges  and if it was resolved without having to follow-up. It is still unresolved.
pos,Only positives! Incredible views of the lake  perfect spacious rooms  great staff  good food at the restaurant. Would love to have stayed longer.
pos,Hotel staff were friendly. Water heater on the shower was a little bit slow to heat but otherwise okey.
pos,I had a great stay with my friends. The breakfast buffet was superb and the view was breathtaking. Highly recommended.
pos,Due to its location  the hotel does not have much competition within its category. Therefore it can be seen as the best hotel  however  it definitely has opportunities to improve  especially in the price range it asks for. Good 1. Beautiful View of the sea 2. Nice lounge 3. Buffet is quite good Opportunities 1.Wifi is very inconsistent and limited 2. I have to walk every day at least 4-6 minutes from my room to the main area (lobby  lounge  etc). quite far 3. The restroom (in my room at least) can use some rennovation as its quite old
pos,Lovely hotel
pos,Our favorite hotel
pos,Everything was great except for the food. Not a lot of selections to choose from and the taste was just so-so.
neg,expensive
pos,Pros: - Breathtaking view of the Taal lake from our room - Very friendly staff - Pretty decent breakfast buffet - Very good food at the Taza restaurant - Decent massage at the hotel's spa - Clean and comfortable Cons: - If you are bringing a baby stroller  there's a rather long walk from the lobby area to the room  if you want to avoid the stairs. - The bathroom and bath tube's sinks were both slow running.
pos,Love the view
pos,there's a newly built wing with new rooms but they should also consider renovating the rooms in the old wing as it is obviously looking old.
pos,"I was able to spend slowly. It is breakfast, but the number of tables in the restaurant is less than the number of accommodations and I will be waiting. I think that the type is good and the quality is good."
pos,"The view from the window is the best. Although I feel that the price seems to be expensive, I decided here if I could do it. There are amusement parks nearby, casinos, good for a little resort."
pos,Love the view and all the staff
pos,Each time I stay in this hotel  I have never been disappointed.
neg,Our group of classmates elected to stay in this resort hotel to have our reunion activities and much to our dismay  the resort hotel failed to meet our bare minimum expectations. The registration process was tedious  disorganized and quite lengthy. The rooms and amenities were jut average. The electronic and projection equipments provided were faulty. The food was just average.The hotel was expecting a horde of people to check in but made no adequate provisions to handle this.
pos,Great food in Taza Restaurant. Worth the money. Soon after we checked in and unpacked our things in the room  a staff unlocked the door of our room from the outside without knocking. It was a very rude behavior. He did not apologize and merely said that he was checking the room. Obviously not a good reason not to knock.
pos,Perfect and excellent location to stay for. A Morning breeze and fresh air breath experience. Friendly and accomodated hotel staff. Should have a complimentry drinks upon arrival. Should have a best value room rates for family 6/8 members. Should have a more variety of foods to select for every meal. Best value meal for customers where breakfast not included in booking. But overall assestment- Taal Vista Hotel excellent for company seminars  team buildings wherein they can demand high hotel rates. But for clients wanted for family bonding  family get together  debut  birfhdays etc ... it is not recommended. It is recommended for high payed costumer. Taal Vista- a hotel evryone's dream for staycation and vacation but at a best value room rates that everybody can afford to check in. Workshops.
pos,Excellent service  great view of Taal lake & volcano  very efficient & kind staff  delicious food. Our family's go-to place whenever we need a vacation at home in Tagaytay.
pos,Best if they update the description of the room - said that it has a partial view of the lake  all we can see is the Sky Ranch beside the hotel. But Taal Vista really has a vast view of the Taal (from the garden) which is amazing.
neg,PROS location staff cons No wifi low hot water supply Value for money If you have the extra cash and want to splurge expecting more than the usual  look elsewhere.
pos,The room we got is a decent size. The bed was big (king size) and was so comfy. The breakfast was good & has a lot of choices.
pos,Great facilities  great view and great location right along the highway
pos,very clean rooms with great view
pos,Everything is great. I only want to say something about the check-in counter staff. Please try NOT to make a couple sleep in separate bed. We checked-in as a couple and was given a room with two twin beds. We did not complain and we just to enjoy our stay to the max. We still slept together in one small bed as we cannot sleep separately.
neg,We've missed our itinerary and the hotel ruined a supposed surprise for a family member because of very poor service during check in. A very embarassing situation caused! The front desk & housekeeping lied to us on the status of one of the 3 rooms we booked. Worst is up to this date they cannot provide us information on the root cause of the problem!
pos,Taal lake view
neg,"It is the second stay last year. Unfortunate, rain of the day. There is nothing you can do outside. Extremely disappointing"
pos,we are frequent
neg,Be careful when booking because the website is misleading. A room on the lake wing does not mean you get a lake view. To get a lake view you must book a premier room  and frankly  the garden view doesn't look over a garden at all. Instead  the garden view looked over the back-of-house delivery/parking area and is not worth the price. After all  the reason to visit this hotel is for the lake view. We visited between Christmas and New Year and surprisingly the hotel was not adequately staffed to look after the rush of guests (i.e. breakfast was a nightmare). The rush should have been properly planned-for by hotel management.
pos,My family of 6 stayed from December 30  2016 to January 1  2017. It was our first time to stay at Taal Vista since we normally go to Baguio for New Year's Eve celebrations. Partied with the rest of the guests at the Countdown party which was a blast. The 2 bands played great music from the 80's! Our room which was the Deluxe King Bed - MountainView was spacious enough although the tub was quite too narrow for our liking. Might cause accidents if one is not careful. As a constructive criticism  for the high room rate being charged to guests  maybe management should consider refurbishing a little to maintain 5 star rating. Not sure if the Lake view rooms are more modern-looking. All staff are so friendly and courteous with a ready smile and attended to all our needs quickly and efficiently. Special mention to Denise from the front desk and Imee (one of the servers at the countdown party). We got a bowl of fruits on our 2nd day and some cookies and marshmallows for the kids too. It was a sweet gesture. Kids loved the sprawling lawns of the hotel and had a fun time sliding down the small slopes. They love that since we live in a condo and there's not much room for play. As a mom  I enjoyed that playtime with them. From the hotel  there is an easy access to the Sky Ranch amusement park but gate closes at 6pm. We got coupons from the front desk at half the price. In a nutshell  it was a great experience and we will be back!
pos,Location and service.
neg,Unfortunately this hotel is in need of a complete refurbishment. I believe they are trading purely on their location and views of Taal Lake.
pos,Love their customer service. Despite the typhoon they manage to make our stay their convinient and hassle free
pos,Spacious rooms  friendly staff 
pos,Excellent view  nice facilities  very near Sky Ranch. Very friendly staff. The traffic in Tagaytay on holidays and long weekends is horrible!!! The towels in the bathroom is a little worn out. The buffet breakfast is a little boring but they have a nice bakeshop where they sell delicious pandecoco and other goddies.
pos,....nice foods  friendly & respectful staff  good location !!!
neg,guests were brought to a very far room from the lobby it's so disappointing
pos,Overall experience was somehow ok. Maybe I just expected too much as this is The Taal Vista that we know and from the rate of the rooms. Pros: Location good Climate pleasant Reception accomodating Cons: Other staffs (bell service  housekeeping) need more professionalism Lack of communication with reception and housekeeping. We are already checkedin the room and the housekeeping didnt knock when he was about to place the fruit basket. Bath tub has molds and the drain is broken kept draining our bath tub water. Finishings are not strategically designed
pos,It was a short extended stay  good to relax and enjoy the fresh air..
pos,Nice rooms and view
pos,A very good place to just chill and relax. The rooms are kinda old  but well provided with toiletries. The towels were clean but should already be replaced with new ones (no longer white!). The mountain view was good except for the houses beside the hotel which are an eyesore (I guess the hotel can't do much about them  though). The breakfast buffet provides a lot of good choices. The view from
pos,This will always be our favorite. Clean and spacious rooms. Nice and accommodating staff. Kudos to the Manager who handles my concern with regard to the AC unit.
neg,nothing special
pos,We had a wonderful stay. And the staff are all.friendly.and.very accomodating..
pos,Service and staff were excellent
pos,Pros good place staff taal view and room Cons malamig na pagkain. Masarap sana pero malamig na... 8am kami kumain ng bfast..
pos,nice modern hotel with historic charm. excellent restaurants
neg,It took 4 hours before i was checked in! Arrived and registered at 11am (i requested for early check in) and was told that the room was no longer occupied but is still for cleaning. I went out for lunch and was back at 1PM only to be told that the room has not been cleaned yet since the room service was still cleaning the rooms near my assigned room. I waited again but there was nowhere to go since it was raining hard in tagaytay. Went back to the front desk at 230PM and now their reason was that the aircon in the room i was assigned needs to be fixed! The experience was so frustrating and to experience this in a 4star hotel is beyond words. Better to choose other boutique hotels in the vicinity they might have better and faster ways of checking you in!
pos,This hotel has the best view of the taal lake and volcano. We love the location as it is very accessible. It is also just beside sky ranch. The staff were very nice and greets you whenever you come across them. This hotel needs some updates in their facilities as it shows the age of the property  it exudes luxury however  some of the facilities look rather outdated. The carpet in front of the ballroom looks aging and it needs an extreme makeover. Our room does not have the best view either  the in room safe was not working properly and the gym equipment is also old.
pos,Big hotel  good scenery  and I love the breakfast. Yet  the room is quite old  and the balcony is really dirty.
pos,Excellent
pos,The staff are every accomodating and friendly. We have a wonderful stay at this hotel.
pos,Amazing biew
pos,Traffic is so bad in the area of Tagaytay
neg,We paid too much for the room that is old  we requested to be transferred they said agoda bookings r allocated only in the old wing  very unprofessional
neg,When I book The price was confirmed 1207 HKD. When I paid 1450HKD (9500 PHP). I'm not going to use Agoda anymore!
pos,The hotel is well maintained and very clean. The front office manager  Mr. Edward Clyde R. Manuel assisted me at the registration desk and I even got a room upgrade with a very nice view of Taal volcano! My only concern was that the registration desk was far from my room and I had to walk about 100 meters to get to the front desk. Aside from the aforementioned  everything was great and I had a pleasant stay..
neg,1. the system is not updated. I was told that i booked 5 rooms but i only booked 3 rooms. I have a room cancellation more than a week before our reservation and i still have to use my data just to let them see my confirmation of cancellation. 2. The first room was given to us at around 12:30pm and I was pleasant about it  but then the 2 other rooms was given to us as late as 5pm. The check in time is 2pm. We should already be enjoying our stay for that 3 hours and yet we were pissed by waiting that long. 3. When the room was given to us  the other room smells like vomit. And the other room that was given to us was at the other building. We went there as family with senior and a 1 year old child. How can we enjoy it when my other relatives were way far. 4. The other rooms didnt have shampoos and conditioner. 5. I asked for an extra pillow at around 5:30pm. The pillow was given to me at 8:30pm  about 5 to 10 minutes after i was angrily followed up my request. 6. i dialled 3 to request a chopstick since it was written there. Then the operator told me to just dialled i think 7 or 6 for my request. They should have just connect me to the right operator (thats how it supposed to be right?) So yeah  im really disappointed
neg,Pros * well mannered hotel staff * nice view Cons * need exterior painting of the mountain View building * staff from the Kultura store/shop need more training on how to handle/assist their customers. We had an experience with one of the staff...
pos,Food wax good staff ok location good view qmwas good
pos,Relaxing
pos,The room and hotel ambiance was nice and comfortable. My two kids enjoyed the view at the view deck. Surely a relaxing experience.
pos,Our favorite hotel in tagaytay .... clean and friendly staffs
pos,A big room with a view of the Taal Lake and Volcano. Great choices of food
pos,The best still in tagaytay
pos,As usual taal vista never miss to amaze us! The location  the ambience and the whole hitel experience is always amazing. Too bad the restaurant is still nit open during our visit but still they deliver.
pos,My boyfriend and I love the food that they serve @ Veranda  i am just hoping our room has the view of Taal..
neg,The view is beautiful but the rooms are terrible dirty couches   bathrooms with no doors!!! Who does that??? Ventilation in the bathroom needs to be over the commode not over the shower !!! They need a new architect or designer!!!
pos,Near Skyranch Tagaytay..
neg,We were assigned to a room which is not very accessible. To be fair  I booked the accomodation online and they were not prewarned that we have a four-month old baby with us and we dont have a babysitter. However  upon check in  they must have seen our situation but they did not initiate our transfer. In the morning we went to veranda for the breakfast buffet. The staff said that there was no small tables available for us so she suggested that we return to the restautant near our room. She did not offer the available larger table to us even if she saw that we were having a hard time carrying our baby and his stuff (stroller & baby bag). They couldve have told us when we checked the option of having breakfast elsewhere- near our room knowing our less ideal situation. My wife had to ask the staff if we could have breakfast outside the veranda. They allowed us but I felt disappointed because they lack the iniative to think of ways to ease our situation.
pos,View is outstanding
pos,We got a two bedroom suite for the holy week break and no regrets.
neg,Pros: Accessible  Lovely view Gave my husband a lovely cake for his birthday Cons: The room that we originally booked had a broken AC. My husband and I were in our bathrobes (that we had to ask for by the way) while the ac repairman checked the unit. We were transferred to another room nearly 6pm. It had no view and was a long walk from everything. That hall wasn't quite kept.
neg,Worst customer service. Gave us the wrong room twice. The third room they gave us is located in the oldest part of hotel which construction is happening. The room had a strange odor. Will never ever visit this hotel again.
pos,- Staff are well entertaining - Facilities are well maintained & Clean - location is near to every tourist destinations & restaurants - room rate is a little bit expensive - Gym area is good but has less space - Pool is nice & clean  but i wish they have heater for water.
pos,It was our anniversary. Perfect for a quiet getaway. The weather cooperated and we basked under the stars and the morning sunshine.
pos,Slightly outdated but still one of the best hotel in tagaytay.
pos,Taal vista hotel provides sumptous food for breakfast. So many choices that anyone will enjoy. Also  the function halls are very convenient for seminars and training. Also  the place is near places to visit in the area.
pos,This hotel has one of the best views in Tagaytay  but be sure to get a PREMIERE room with a balcony in the Lake Wing. The hotel's breakfast buffet has a great selection. The hotel spa is also a good way to relax and you can have your massage in your room as well. A good place to relax and recharge on weekends away from the city
pos,Super food for brakfast and lunch  but snacks shpuld not always be bread
neg,We booked a room which says facing the lake but we got a room facing trees and grass when we arrived. We asked for guidance from the reception and they said they will change rooms. It took 30 minutes of waiting until we were transferred to a different room. The new room was even awful  the views of trees and grass were gone and it was replaced by a view of wall. It was really a very bad experience. We thought that the price of this hotel speaks for itself but we were wrong. It is an expensive hotel with not so accommodating staff and not so clean facilities. Not going to book again to this hotel.
pos,I've stayed at this hotel a number of times and will stay there again. Good Value for money.
pos,Excellent view deck. Rooms. Very clean CR although no bidet.
pos,Expensive
pos,Capture the great view Of the taal lake besides is the skyrange access-able to all places.
pos,My family and I had an overnight stay 2 weeks ago... we got the Mountain View Suite (2 bedrooms  Receiving and Dining Area). We were supposed to check in at 2pm (or was it 3pm) but due to a broken AC  we were able to check in at 4.30 pm. If we only knew that only 1 AC is broken  we could have at least put our luggages in and we had started hanging out. But for some reason  the staff didn't tell us right away the problem. But despite of that  we didn't make a scene in the lobby and the Duty Manager was very apologetic anyway. Sh*t happens as they say and both parties never wanted it anyway. The DM offered a free SPA but we said  we just wanted to put down out things so we can go out. When they found out that it's ok with us to let the AC fix while we're away  they gave the card keys and told us we can have a late checkout (till 5pm) the following day. The Suite is superb! We got complimentary fruit platter  chocolate cake and I think 8-10 non-alcoholic beverages. Good thing as well is that I think  all of the Managers were aware of the trouble we had during the check in so everytime we passed by the lobby.. they kept on apologizing :D Upon check out  I told them that we consumed 1 bottle of Smirnoff but they did not charge it anymore  well  just to make up for the trouble hehehe... The place is perfect! Great view of the Taal Lake/Volcano.. even if we got the Mountain View Suite  we have a view of the Taal Volcano :) The View Deck is clean... the food is delish (breakfast buffet).. the amenities and wonderful :) Will be back here for sure!
pos,Friendly staff
pos,Good staff  good place and good food
neg,This hotel needs to train their staff on how to handle complaints. Their breakfast buffet was scheduled at 6-10 am. My family and I went to the Veranda restaurant to avail of the inclusive buffet breakfast at 8am but there was a looong queue!! I understand there were a lot of patrons in the hotel considering its halloween but it took another hour and 15 pissed guests waiting in line for them to decide to open up the lobby area to accommodate these people..The staff even reiterated that the bfast buffet was only until 10am when we got seated at around 9.30am!! How stupid and inconsiderate! Some other staff would just stare at u without even acknowledging your questions.Some guests actually came here to experience having a good bfast with the view but with this kind of service its no wonder this place lost the prestige it once had.
neg,Good food and Awesome Place. Just let the place know if your Cignal cable is not working  and they will fix it for you. Weird that the leftover foods and utensils are just lying around outside of the rooms. And the swimming pool's a bit crowded. But anyhow  the overall experience is very good.
pos,Fantastic view of the Taal lake and mountains. Unfortunately the hotel is old and interiors are worn out. It needs to be refurbished and upgraded.
neg,1.inform us during checkin that everything is settled not knowing during checkout that we need to pay full amount for the stay (booking charge never captured) taal vista or agoda problem? i dont know. its caused too much hassle. 2. room description stated mountain view but all we can see is a wall feature of the hotel which behind that is trees. 3. sliding door to veranda cannot be open 4. ordered food (pasta) room service almost 1hr+ to arrive unfortunately this is not we expected.
pos,They upgraded our room to the presidential mountain view suite for our wedding! The service was great and they were very accomodating to us.
pos,Had a wonderful time here  spectacular views and a great in house Restaurant
pos,Nice hotel with great views.
pos,good for staycation with nice view of taal
pos,We stayed for 2 nights  is very convenient if you are planning to visit Skyranch. Food were great too  but expensive.
pos,Celebrated my friend's birthday here. Thanks for the complimentary cake and card.
neg,The room is not clean and not convincing
pos,View and hotel is great
pos,Such a wonderful place best hotel in Tagaytay in my opinion the breakfast buffet was good I enjoyed the garlic rice and pastries most although the waiters and waitresses should be more attentive to the patrons at the buffet. The rooms were top notch very clean internet was also top notch very friendly room service was hit or miss some items were decently priced while others were quite high but you get what you pay for! Gym is small but a nice workout can be had in their gym. Also my wife enjoyed the massage they gave to her located nearby the gym area
pos,The place is nice but some areas look old. Maybe the hotel should consider renovating their rooms.
pos,Staff are so accomadating.yummy buffet and of course the view that tells it all!
pos,The spa is great with courteous staff. Food is good dueing breakfast.
pos,Great service and great view
pos,Pros: nice view of Taal Volcano  it's proximity to the malls  restaurants and attractions. Cons: none
pos,Nice place good location
pos,I think you just need to replace the bed and pillows to a softer one
pos,near the good spots in tagaytay (sky ranch  zoo  bag o beans  sonya's garden). . . place was clean and spacious but the elevator broke and it was scary - i had to use the stairs to the 3rd floor though was afraid I will be trapped.
pos,The place is clean and the staff is courteous. They have very good breakfast buffet. Location is also near to other fun activities with the kids - sky ranch  zoo and Sonya's Garden
neg,"I stayed in Premier King by seeing Tar Lake on 9 / 22-24. The room is too large. It is a pity that 1F of Premier King goes up stairs once and descends to 1F with elevator. It's tough to have a heavy suitcase and go up the stairs even at noon. Also, it was surprising (the worst) that the carcass of the moth fell from the faucet when shedding water at the washroom. I think that there is no problem other than that. The Japanese did not see it."
pos,All staff make all guests special attention. You can see all of them appreciate the business that customers are giving them.
pos,great hotel great views
neg,The price is high but the room is a little old. And it is noisy in the late and early morning. And also think the buffet is also not worth that money. But the staff are all good!
pos,Your usual hotel  right next to a park and with a view of taal volcano. Ambince is a bit okf and you can somehow smell that old wood on the floor. Overall good but may not worth the price.
pos,I booked Taal Vista because I wanted beautiful aerial video coverage for my wedding. The place definitely didn't disappoint though it was on the pricey side. There was a lot of items left in the room when we checked out but the hotel staff kept everything and I was able claim them back.
pos,Good location Friendly staff Receptionist not accommodable Old rooms  needs general repair Few dishes in buffet Breakfast
pos,The place was very cozy with a beautiful view of Taal Volcano. The place looks clean and tidy. I didn't get the chance to try their buffet breakfast because I had a wedding to attend to and have to be there early. They were nice enough to provide take out sandwich instead. (I expected it to be more than that. It would have been nice if they actually gave a portion of what they will serve during the buffet breakfast.) I stayed in the Lake View Wing and couldn't connect to their WiFi while in the room. Mountain View Wing has better WiFi connection.
pos,always a busy hotel  lots of weddings  lots of guests. its the biggest in tagaytay i think which is why it draws the most crowds. it is not a quiet hotel there is always something happening. you lose the provincial  quiet  vacation appeal but overall we're satisfied.
pos,I like the gym and other facilities. Breakfast wasnt great it was too salty.
pos,Very nice hotel except their mountain wing area. Desperately need to be renovated and the rooms there should not be rented out to customers. Staff performance is good. Very helpful.
pos,Room is great
pos,Stayed in during the long weekend for the birthdays of my mom and daughter. Everyone from valet to front desk to housekeeping and phone operators to the restaurant team are excellent and friendly  which made up for not getting the correct room with the lake/mountain view. (Agoda  please correct your remark that says mountain view to mountain wing or mountan side  because it is the lake side or lake wing that has the real mountain and lake view.)
pos,Fun for the family
pos,This is definitely a place for families. Breakfast buffet was wonderful and the location is very good. You are close to so many other restaurants in case you want to try other dishes besides hotel food. The rooms were clean and well kept.
pos,Very nice
pos,this is the best view of the taal lake and volcanoe. near to everything. bulalo point  sonias garden. and most of all people in tagaytay are honest. buffet breakfast was also good.
pos,Peaceful  nice hotel and view
pos,If you want a good view of Taal  this hotel has it from their view deck.
pos,Dont book at Lake Wing if you're with an elderly cause it's far from the reception and breakfast hall. You might wanna park also at the other building or basement. Bathroom has no bidet. But the cherry on top of our stay was the beautiful sunset from our veranda. Book Lake Wing if you want to experience the panoramic view of Taal Volcano. But if you're always on the go  just book the cheaper ones.
pos,Cool weather versatile for rest and relaxation except swimming not advisable due to cold pool. Value for money will be excellent if with addl perks like free fruits and wine or free cocktail drinks. Although room is excellent as it is.
pos,I have positive and negative things to say about Taal Vista. Positive: Staying at the hotel  you can never get bored. There's a kids club for the kids  and other facilities (gym  pool - but we didn't use them). Food is awesome  their breakfast buffet has a variety of food choices. Negative: We were offered an upgrade for a bigger room at the new wing. I wonder how new that wing was  because the elevator we used  musty. The room that we initially stayed at (we asked for a room change)  broken bathroom door. Honestly  the upgrade wasn't worth it. When we were also going to our room  this is past the checkin time now. The hallway is lined with used food trays and majority of the rooms are still being cleaned.
pos,Only gripe would be the check in and check out. Took so long to go inside the room despite reserving it a day before. Said check in was at 10 am and I was there at 8am. Clearance is also a little slow. So it took around 20 minutes before we finally checked out of the hotel.
pos,It's realy a nice location  my friends enjoyed their stay so much.
pos,Stayed in this hotel in Aug 2016. Facilities were amazing. Swimming pool was small though. The bathroom was nice with separate toilet  bath and sink. I just didn't like that it was just divided by glass. No physical door to seclude the bathroom from the bedroom. They gave us a nice cake for our anniversary. There were refreshments (cucumber citrus i think) while waiting for check-in. By the way  check-in took too long maybe because it was a long weekend and the hotel was packed with guests. But we still enjoyed the facilities and the tagaytay environnment.
pos,our first room didn't smell good  however after a few minutes we were transferred to a better accommodation. Elder individuals should be cautious of the bath tub as this might prove to be a bit slippery in climbing in.
pos,Great food  friendly staff  delicious food and awesome day spa with great massages
neg,generally  I think we will not go back to this hotel anymore.
pos,Everything else was ok  the place food and the weather. But the way the room was kept was very bad. We checked in at 8pm giving the establishment much time to clean. But when we got in and check the bathroom  there we falling hair scattered in the place and the bathtub was still wet. Though rooms are a bit old  they should do something with the scent.. It would have been a perfect location. I hope they renovate their rooms soon and housekeeping should improve.
pos,Wonderful location with the Best scenery of Tasl Volcano and Lake! I highly recommend this hotel above any others in the Tagaytay area!!
pos,Convenient
pos,nice view if you're on Lake View side  good breakfast
pos,I enjoyed my stay i like the view of taal lake and the fogs enjoyed the fogs inside our room.A very satisfying stay I am impressed with the buiding it doesnt look old but well maintained.
pos,The only problem we encountered was  the elevator was under repair.
pos,Pls chek the comfort rooms and bath tubs and d water heater is not too hot
pos,Nice place
pos,Nice place
neg,they gave me a different room... it took us one hour and half before the onduty manager decided to upgrade us  why it took you so long?
pos,just went there to play Golf
pos,very nice view. but my room was with lake view  it was very far from lobby and restaurant and coffee
pos,Check In was a loooooong wait. Booked two rooms. I got the second room around 4pm. I was told that I was going to be called to inform me when the second room is available but that never happened. I tried calling the front desk a couple of times but no one answered. I had to go to the front desk and wait in line again just to know whether my second room is available or not. thankfully it was. I actually had to challenge for my first room beddings. I booked a king and a single bed room which was pretty clear in this sites description. Front Desk lady at that time said there was no room of that type and had to ask another colleague. Until they just suggested to provide an additional single bed in my first room. As we enter the second room  true enough there was indeed a proper king and single type room. Breakfast - I'm fine with walking from one end of the property to another but imagine I can just imagine how hard it would be for someone who has problems walking. From Room 110 of Mountain view to Breakfast buffet area (Ballroom 2-3) in Lake view side. No elevators. Food itself was ok. Other than the above  all else were fine but nothing great. Can be better.
pos,There was a long queue during check in. We were finally served at 330pm and Receptionist informed us that there is no room available yet despite my confirmed booking at the Lake View section of the hotel. Keys to our room was given at 415pm. To my dismay  our room has no view of the lake. Anyways  room is not cleaned well  I saw used bedroom sleepers under the bed and a lot of dust/dirt. There is even no enough tissue in the toilet (only 1 roll is installed in the toilet). AC is not cold. Location of Taal Vista is the main reason why I booked here. Near to anywhere.
pos,Do not book Lake Wing rooms as the check in a disaster  the rooms no door for the bathroom and the view from the rooms is terrible at best.
neg,I used to like this hotel. I have stayed here before and the previous experiences were good. This time  however  was disappointing. Ill summarise: Good: 1. Staff - very friendly and accomodating. 2. Location - ideally located. Bad: 1. Stains on the couch. 2. Mini-bar was absolutely empty. 3. Incomplete room items. We noticed no bathrobes and razors. We called and requested for them  and they arrived 2 HOURS LATER. I don't know what changed  but this was a very disappointing visit to this hotel  which was once the go-to place in Tagaytay.
pos,Please improve Breakfast quality and location. You have nice view from hotel. You should provide Breakfast space with Taal Volcano View. Anyway  It was nice hotel.
neg,While we have been to many hotels around the World  sometimes we come across a hotel that is rated as a 5 star but certainly is not  the Taal Vista Hotel in Tagaytay is one of these establishments. Although there are some nice aspects  this hotel in my opinion is way overrated and would be a 3 or 3.5 star hotel at best. As you can see by the photos  the view is incredible. What is sad is that you pay dearly for this view and it is available at many dozens of locations for half the cost. The facilities are dated (hotel was originally built in 1939)  but it does not have the regal charm of a hotel erected in that era. Instead it looks like an average facility that is desperately attempting to keep up with the times  but they are failing badly. They are even too cheap to buy a lawnmower and literally mow huge areas with a weed eater. This makes the grounds look hideous. The breakfast was basically the same every day overcooked eggs  Tang served as Orange Juice (not one bit of juice in the mixture)  stale bread and overall nothing like a five star buffet. All of this was put in a conference room as their normal restaurant was being renovated (something they neglected to mention when I made my reservation). Even the newspaper provided at breakfast was two days old. The food served in the lobby caf was poor as well. We sat for a very long time before acknowledged  they brought us a dish we did not ask for  did not bring what we ordered and even charged us for the unwanted item. Grossly over-priced for what we got! If we wanted to use their car service to return home  the charge was 5 TIMES the cost that we paid for a private sedan to bring us here! Double might fly with me  but five times for the same service and distance is ridiculous! The rooms are adequate  but average. We wanted to get a larger room but according to the online reservations no larger rooms exist in the hotel. Bathrooms are a bit dated and the bathtub is so badly narrow
pos,The stay was awesome  good location and good view..checking in just took time since only one staff was assisting and the other was on the phone. The one over the phone didn't asked or inquire of our need and had eye contact with him already but when he saw a foreigner came he quickly asked and processed his check-in. So much for being a filipino  Anyways all was good except for that  satisfactory.
pos,Words cannot express but this place is just awesome 
pos,Visitor has to take note booking Mountain View wing (old structure) while Lake View Wing (newer facilities). A weekend treat was unpleasant due to uncivilized guest adjacent room noisy late night till wee hours. Front desk unable to answer telephone. Bath towels old as well not in class with the hotel rating  need to replace to bring better standard. Talking with Resto Manager Ms. Cristina was a big relief and very responsive staff. Now under better management wishing the hotel will regain the prestige as Tagaytay's Best.
pos,Nice view  good food and friendly staff
neg,Rooms are very old. Very disappointing. I did not get value for my money. Breakfast food is as disappointing as their rooms
pos,food was great esp the veggie salad in pineapple vineagrette. friendly staff.
pos,Service is poor  slow in taking orders and serving orders.
pos,Would go back here anytime!
pos,The ambiance and the place itself are exquisite  although the price is a bit pricey not just the room rate but also the swiss chocolate buffet coz its just small chocolates but the rate is pricey. I love the breakfast buffet.well overall it's fantastic.
pos,Stayed for a mini get away from home! EXCELLENT SERVICE  BREAKFAST IS GREAT! OUR ROOM HAS A VERANDA FACING THE LAKE BUT I WISH WE WERE ASSIGNED ON A HIGHER FLOOR SO THAT THE VVIEW WILL BE BETTER. !!
pos,overall  a good stay  though price is steep.
pos,Hope they can finish renovetion. Will surely back.
neg,Premium Lake Side Room: Upon checking in we were offered an upgrade to a premium room for an additional 1 500 pesos which we gladly accepted. Our first day was ok. Wi-Fi was excellent. However  when we woke up the first morning there was a puddle of water due to a leaking split type A/C. Luckily our boys were still asleep and my husband was able to place one of the robes before anyone slips on their tile floor. They had their engineering service come to fix the leak. He came back a short time later to fix the leak again. The 3rd time they had the engineering manager assess the problem which he concluded was a problem with the drainage and he called front desk to have us relocate to another room. Upon getting settled to the second room  the shower smelled musty and there was a group of flying insects all gathered in one lower left corner of the shower stall. House keeping came and sprayed with lysol and said it was resolved. But upon checking the insects were now on the ceiling and towels. We asked to be relocated again. Everything was fine with the 3rd room but come night time as we were getting ready for bed the split type A/C started dripping again. Engineering came and fixed the problem. Then as we were about to fall asleep there was this dragging noise coming from above our room that continued till past midnight. Front desk claims that security already went and assessed the area and found no disturbance but the noise continued. We called the front desk 4 times before the noise stopped. Altogether we lost more than half of the day during our first full day. We couldn't leave due to the ongoing problems. We lost half of our nights sleep from our second night. Breakfast Buffet: Our two sons availed for the morning breakfast buffet only to be stopped by a lady who told my younger son that he may not join their breakfast wearing a tank top. My sons went back to our room to change but when they got in they saw two other kids with a tank top on. Complete disapp
pos,I am very pleased with my stay here  I booked a room in the mountain ridge wing; the bed is very huge can accommodate as much as 3 persons. I love the balcony wherein you can see portion of the Taal Lake while having a cup of coffee or any of your favorite drink. If you love Breakfast Buffet you'll surely love their complimentary breakfast  there's a huge variety of food whether Filipino or American dishes. 5 stars for the staff's they're very accommodating and will attend all your needs in just one call. All is well when you stay here in Taal Vista Hotel.
pos,Needs to improve the old part   the old buildings.. Not quite comfortable rooms.. More to improve..
pos,Nice Hotel
neg,Location and Good Service but have lost the good old days of Taal Vista Lodge.
neg,Pros: - Their restaurant was fantastic. The food was delicious. Highly recommend the sole. - The view from the Lake View rooms makes for great pictures. - The hotel is located near all the major must-sees and restaurants in Tagaytay. There's plenty of parking as well. - Get a massage in your room! It was relaxing and they were polite. - Room service came on time and everything we ordered was satisfactory. Cons: - Big floor space for the bathroom but the tub was so small that you couldn't stand for a shower with two feet flat on the ground. The curve was so narrow that I kept feeling like I was going to fall over. There was no hot water. The shower head was broken so it was only one stream of extremely high pressured water (painful). The toilette uses recycled water (which is fine) but the water reeked of sewage and stank up the bathroom. The fixtures were dirty and broken. - My parent's room had a broken door to the balcony so they couldn't close it. Their air conditioner was dripping too. This was dangerous as they were both senior citizens. - The food at the lobby cafe was disappointing. The cakes were stale and dry although the hot chocolate was fine.
pos,clean big hotel but the food is not that good far from the main entrance.
neg,At time of arrival  we have requested of an early check-in but instead they have given us a late checking  they promise for an hour but end up waiting for 1 1/2 hour  the food on the lobby cafe taste good but the hot drinks wasnt really HOT  the receptionist was so polite  however her action was more on showing the SOP rather than really communicating to the guest. We were amazed of the scenery on their viewing deck and garden but some part of the hotel was under renovation which was kind a disturbing. Our plan was to go early at the skyranch  but due to the late booking we end up with coming late and the rain was already pouring and we didnt enjoy all the nice ride  (wasting the entrance fee). Coming back to the hotel In the evening we were expecting to have a peaceful night and good sleep but end up waking in the middle of the night due to some guests who were trying to open our door harshly and to my surprise 4 men were outside INCLUDING a hotel personnel who did'nt even think that they might be opening the wrong Room!!!???. And in the morning swimmingpool was closed  they say its because of the bad weather - this day wasn't really FOR US... But I will recommend the place to my friends because of the Nice Sceneries and garden
pos,big rooms. accesible to everything
pos,I enjoyed my stay and the spa services
pos,We have been to Tagaytay for quite a number of times but this is the first time we decided to have a spontaneous weekend vacation in Taal Vista Hotel. Our stay in Taal Vista Hotel was very refreshing .. Away from metro manila but not to far from metro manila. We stayed by the Mountain Wing .. It was generally nice  peaceful and we truly enjoyed our 3D/2N weekend staycation. But since Mountain Wing side is the oldest side of the hotel you can somehow feel its old ambiance  maybe a little repainting can cure it. It was clean but the shower curtain kindda smell damped. I wish they check on that  but over all it was a good stay and a very peaceful respite from the hustle and bustle over crowded manila. Food was great. Good enough for everyone who came for the breakfast buffet. Maybe next time i will try staying by the Lake Side Wing.. Its their newer bldg. 
pos,Taal Vista Lodge is a comfortable setting to enjoy Tagaytay. Great views to Lake Taal
pos,Checked in on a Sunday night hoping to wake up to the view of Taal Lake and Volcano. We were given a room on the 3rd floor of the left wing. Noticed handprints on the glass windows and the room starting to look a little dated. Looked forward to waking up to the nice view but alas  it was obstructed by well fog  and by the tops of the trees in front. Also chose this hotel for the fabled breakfast overlooking the lake. Only to have it in one of the ballrooms because Cafe Veranda is under renovation till September. The hotel could use some updating in terms of interiors. And it should. i guess for now the only thing worth what you pay for when choosing this hotel is the view which you can appreciate from the deck. And the pan de coco and Spanish bread from the cake shop. The breads from the buffet breakfast were also better than in most hotels so kudos to the bakers of the hotel. Wait staff during breakfast were also very nice  along with the guard on the 3rd floor who escorted us when checking out. And the front desk and valets. Hope hotel management can do much-needed renovations soon.
pos,we enjoyed staying at this hotel because of good locations and cool climate
pos,The overall facilities don't really merit the price... Lots of tiles and cement around. Rooms are spacey and ok  and restaurants are nice.
pos,It would be better if they would have more F&B staff during breakfast. They have a lot of guests  that could fill up a ballroom  but they have very limited staff. Some simple requests  like coffee and tea - breakfast defaults  were not served even after a few follow ups.
pos,Loved the place close to everything.
pos,Stayed at the Lake Wing and the view was great  though I wished they would have a separate front desk at the Lake Wing to avoid the long walk towards the main lobby. 
pos,had a chance to stay at the old wing and the new wing in different occassions (old wing is very close to the Sky Ranch and noisy too). better facilities and doesnt smell like molds in the new wing. they mixed up our bags this time and it took hours before we can get the matter resolved with the staff. location is at the center of everything. Taal Vista is a classic  can't go wrong
pos,The only issue was the room service time for meals and restaurant dine-in time. It seemed understaffed which may been due to the reinvention of the normal dinning area and kitchen aside from that everything was great.
pos,Hotel is nice  comfortable  great location- very near and walking distance to Skyranch. Nice view of Taal Lake as well.
pos,All the staff are friendly and accomodating. Breakfast is also good. We got the room with balcony facing taal volcano.
pos,We loved the place but the room was in the far end of the hotel and we arrived late in the evening  hallways were very dark
neg,The stairs walking distance is long.
neg,This was the fourth time we used Taal Vista. It took more than 30 mins to be checked-in. It has always been disappointing to be kept waiting for check-in. We had prepaid for the room and indicated the time of arrival but it was of no avail. The room was poorly decorated and the linen was stale. The shower was also not working well and the toilet bowl was stained. The experience was 3 -star and not 5-star.
pos,we will be back .Thank you
neg,we stayed over the weekend for father's day celebration and we were really looking forward to it since it was our first time staying in Taal Vista. we have been planning and saving for it. we stayed in one of the premier rooms overlooking Taal Lake and there was a series of disappointing events during our stay. first  our AC was not working and we had to call several times  my son and i could not sleep and when my husband called  already agitated and almost to the point of cursing  they went ahead and transferred us to another room. earlier in the night  we ordered room service  it took more than 40 minutes and the food was already cold when it arrived. in our new room  the AC was leaking  good thing i saw it early on otherwise i could have slipped (and i am pregnant for that matter!) at lunch time the next day we ordered food again (i know  we didn't learn) it took more than one hour and the food was cold again when it arrived and only after several follow ups. i admit the view from our room was really great but you can get the same view from any other hotels along the ridge for lesser amount of money. when we checked out  the duty manager talked to us and apologized  he said he wished he could have talked to us earlier so he could have done something but then he also said he saw our complaints in their record which means he could have reached out to us and not wait until we were checking out. we were really disappointed and promised not to stay in this hotel again. we didn't get the value for our money - it's not worth it!
pos,Our family always enjoy staying at TVH. The place is very warm and the staff always smiles. Some points of improvement for Mountain wing as we got a total of 6 rooms - The fridge is dirty and didn't really work properly. Some bathroom doors cannot be locked and my sisters room had clogged shower area. It also seems like the pool is small for a big hotel. Overall  TVH is so lovely we keep on coming back
neg,Book a room with a view of the lake otherwise you will be looking onto the rest of the hotel. Didn't like the fact there was no door on the bathroom. Swimming pool was also disappointing. Breakfast was also disappointing.
pos,Nice service and good food
pos,Booked two Superior rooms and stayed overnight. The pool is nice but would be better if it was heated. The electric kettle was broken though and they did not have all the proper towels a usual 4 or 5-star hotel has (hand towel  face towel  etc.). Tiles are uneven and WiFi is wonky half the time. Breakfast was not as good as expected either. Staff are polite and courteous though.
pos,Its a very nice place to check in when you are in the Phils. Feel so close to nature. The facilities and staff were good. Had a great stay in Taal.
pos,Happy and satisfied
pos,Just an average hotel  overrated... just paying for the view... small pool  friendly staff 3.8/5 rating
pos,The food at Cafe Veranda and at Taza are worth the visit. The free breakfast buffet had a lot of options. They continuously refilled the food until before 10am. Food was good and service was excellent. Waiters were attentive. Room was clean and comfortable but the washroom set-up was weird. There was no closed door. Washrooms outside the rooms were clean and smelled great. Will definitely come back!
pos,It was a great stay.
neg,When I booked on line it was stated there that the rooms have king size bed but upon check in there were only two pathetic small beds! Check in supposedly at 2pm but by 4pm room not yet available!! Their king size bed is more like queen sized with small pillows! Everything is just so awful n old the facilities n the building. Definitely not going back there ever! Brrakfast is so so not like few years back!
pos,The stay was really great.
neg,Room was disgusting with its rate of 7 500. It was also dirty. bed linen and pillow case with marks of stains and rust. The toilet bowl has a yellow marks seems not scrub properly. The room looks so dull. the only compensation are the staff who are very friendly and courteous.
pos,Rooms are far from the main builiding making it a little UNFRIENDLY if you have small kids. Staff need to consider the guest' need first rather their 'SUBJECT TO AVAILABILITY policy. We were give a room in a floor with no elevator access and far from the stairs even with knowledge that I am staying with a baby. After complaining they were able to address our needs. Ambiance was good and there were courteous staff all around.
pos,I love this hotel. The breakfast wasn't the best but pretty good. I enjoyed the waffles. The view at this hotel is amazing. We had lake side views and the fog would roll in right at us. It was very nice. The swimming pool was a relaxing break. The rooms and the cleanliness are good and like a 4 or 5 star hotel should be. The staff were all friendly and helpful. I had no issues and no problems and I truly enjoyed my stay here. Amazing management to keep this hotel at the top. Thank you Taal Vista.
pos,We love the hotel with the beautiful scenic of the Taal volcano  the morning breakfast is good with variety choices especially traveling with young children.
pos,STAFF WAS VERY COURTEOUS. LOCATION IS NOT SO TRAFFIC.
pos,Nice view of Taal
neg,We had checked in at the Lake Wing  the view is really nice  especially for us who saw the mt.taal for the first time. I find the rate a little expensive though  but I guess it`s all worth it. I got a little disappointed only that the kids club is under maintenance/renovation.
pos,Excellent hotel  location and very friendly staff
pos,I reserved for a Deluxe Ridge with king size bed and single bed on a 38sq.m. room with balcony but what I got is the usual Deluxe Room without the extra single bed and balcony. Receptionist mentioned that the room is currently under renovation. Should not be included in the room choices. My son was also disappointed that the playroom is on-going renovation. They should have transferred it to a new room instead of shutting it down. They did that for the Gym and Game Room. Hotel should realize that Taal Vista  to many of us is a family hotel and children are definitely part of the family.
pos,Still the best hotel in tagaytay. Staff are very accomodating. The room is very clean and spacious. manage to book a queen size bed + single bed for 4 and adults. Best buffet breakfast in tagaytay. Very clean and very relaxing. To improve: Swimming pool need to be upgraded and it would be nice to have a kiddie room.
pos,My Dad use to take us here every year..now i get to take my kids also..so much fond memories..
pos,My experience was great! We got a huge discount since my parents are senior citizens. Room is also great as we were in the new wing.
pos,Needs improvement with their breakfast buffet. Still no bidet in their bathrooms
pos,Nice location
pos,Its okay.. Maybe better if theres a bidet
pos,We had so much fun. Food was great and we loved Asmara Spa so much! Thank you!
pos,For a countryside visit like Taal Vista-Tagaytay  Room price is somewhat awful. No beach to entertain us  just the cozy & silent room. But to some it up  the place is good & security is excellent.
pos,The place was not that of a five star. Carts were lacking that we needed to carry our stuffs whereas we were there to be relaxed. Some crew were not trained to greet customers. The bed i booked was one king size and 1 single and yet we were given two singles- I paid for 8k. It took long before the housekeeper arrived to arrange our beds. Hope things will improve. Thanks!
pos,It was nice experience..nice ambiance..cozy
pos,What else can I say wonderful and very pleasant and relaxing place
pos,5star hotel with atm pool coffee shop breagfast very good
pos,Near sky ranch very good
pos,Everything is superb  huge parking space  friendly and efficient staff  the hotel was neat  breakfast buffet was great! Excellent view! Only thing missing is bidet.
pos,I had a wonderful time. Although I stayed for an overnight with my friend  it was worth it! Love the scenic! You must visit this hotel. Great staff! They're very accommodating. The Taal Vista hotel exceeded my expectations! I cannot wait to come back.:)
pos,Great place. This hotel is historic  decent and classy  with prime location and great service. I would have tried many different places in Tagaytay but this would be my favourite. I highly recommend staying in a lake view suite for just a little bit more money. The cultural show of traditional dances on weekends are an awesome treat too especially for overseas tourists.
pos,Nice Staff and services
pos,The hotel rate is expensive and not at par with international standard. It is not worth the money I paid. It didn't meet my expectations. Food is lousy  bland and some of them served cold. Hotel is quite big and not vibrant. However  hotel location and Taal Lake view is nice.
pos,Perfect balcony view of Taal Volcano. No shuttle bus/car. Food was OK. We can hear noise in our room.
pos,Enjoyable and Fun!
pos,Taal Volcano can be viewed from this beautiful hotel. It is truly breathtaking. The rooms and amenities are wonderful.
pos,Room and t&b are big which is good... But it has no bidet
pos,Best hotel in Tagaytay. Staff are all friendly and provide excellent service.
pos,nice hotel
neg,hotel is very old
pos,Taal Vista is next to Sky Ranch where the highest perched Ferris wheel in the Philippines is located. It is also pretty close to establishments where you may buy things you may need  and to dining places if you want to eat outside of the hotel. Their view deck is one of the best  if not the best places in Tagaytay where you may enjoy the volcano within a lake Taal volcano.
pos,location was perfect for kids and view of taal lake
pos,quite good ambience
pos,Great location. Fresh air. Panoramic view. Courteous and pleasant staff.
neg,Nothing special
neg,Cobwebs and bird droppings in the veranda. The bed is not comfortable. For a premier suite  it's not worth it at all.
neg,Towels need to be changed. They look old.Overall the stay is comfortable . Buffet Breakfast needs to have better choices for the price of the room. No view at all at the Mountain side wing. Ground flr is noisy better take higher flrs if on this wing. .
pos,Unforgettable with good memories.
pos,It was great
pos,One of the best hotel  we enjoyed staying here we will be back again that's for sure
neg,The bathroom and room was dirty.. Behind the bathroom door and in the corners hair and dirt.. The tables in the room were dusty and not clean.. Very noisy all night and all day.. Made the reservation lake view and paid extra when I got there they said my room type didn't have such a view.. They have only one car to serve the hotel..
neg,"In the deluxe room, I made a reservation, but there was no bathtub in the deluxe room, no hot shower was hot and it was the worst."
pos,The view from the room is worth splurging on! It is the perfect place for a staycation. The location is good  it is also located beside Sky Ranch. The staff was friendly  especially the manager who went out of her way to assist us and accommodate our requests despite having numerous clients during our stay in December. Definitely a memorable stay. :)
pos,Very good as usual. Whenever we stay in Tagaytay  it's always at Taal Vista. We've tried several other hotels but we keep coming back to this hotel.
pos,The stay at Taal was wonderful- we ate both dinner and breakfast in the hotel and both were delicious. The dining area overlooks the beautiful lake and the view is beautiful. We checked out at noon  left our luggage at the front dest  and went to Ta'al to hike up to the Volcano. We planned on going back to the hotel to collect our luggage and heading straight for the airport from there. We had no idea how dusty and dirty we would be after the hike  so we arrived back to the hotel in a state unfit for flying. The wait staff was extremely accommodating when we asked for a place we might be able to quickly shower before leaving for the airport. They let us use their Spa showers and provided us with towels  robes and slippers free of charge!! It was such a lifesaver and we were so incredibly appreciative! I cannot say enough about the incredible service at this beautiful hotel!
pos,Celebrated my dad's birthday here. They even provided woth a complimentary cake with greetings on it plus a candle to blow. Dad felt so loved. Thank you Taal Vista staffs! You are all amazing.
neg,Oh it was terrible when we taking our breakfast buffet.. asking for coffee 5 times we asked they served cold coffee but they put in a big cup instead of regular coffee cup   no small spoon for coffee.. no plates and glasses on the rack. They don't fill in the food container when its up pity for the late person taking there breakfast less choices. Please improve customer service
pos,Room was clean. Bed was great. But my stay could have been better if the pillows were soft. I hope Taal Vista will change their pillows. As a 5-star hotel  I am expecting a better pillows.
pos,A great escape from stress
neg,The check-in staff our not helpful  we had high expectations from them
pos,The staff were all helpful and corteous and the view is great as expected. We got a room at the ridge view  The room is spacious but we were disappointed with the bed which was hard and there was a stuffy smell on the room and toilet. We were excited to try the spa as well but we feel that the service is lacking. The massage was good but they dont have an overall feel  they also dont have sauna and jacuzzi compared to getting an 800php massage from the spa.
pos,Really nice location
neg,Check in was a bit on the disappointing side. Booking was made mid-week  so it was not that busy for sure. Overnight trip was in celebration of an 8th year anniversary. Reserved the best (e.g. most expensive) room available and front desk wanted to provide one of the worse rooms (no view  bottom floor). To their credit  when questioned  they corrected  but why would I have to do that in the first place. Room itself was extremely basic. Aircon was leaking (it was just overnight so didn't even complain). closet doors were broken and off hinges. Property is nice and location is great for where I wanted to go (Antonios)  but wouldn't stay there again.
pos,It was a great  wonderful and relaxing stay with Taall Vista Hotel. Staff are very accommodating  courteous and helpful.
pos,Not that awesome hotel  but definitely the one you should go to when you plan to be in Tagaytay.
pos,We enjoyed staying in this hotel  and for sure we will come back again.
neg,good save to not so clean some of the rooms especially the basement rooms ... deluxe ridge rooms seems neglected and not so convenient to relax.
pos,Excellent
pos,Ive been there for 3 times now.. And i think i will be back again. Its the best place to relax if you want some quiet place and also best place for business meetings
pos,It was good  sad that we have to go right away. The only thing was there's no bidet sprayer.
pos,Excellent. I was so happy to be assisted by their staff denise when i did my proposal to my girlfriend. Very accomodating and helpful.people like her will definitely bring more clients to taal vista!
pos,Out Lake Side room had no view. TV had no USB slot to play movies. Breakfast was great. View from View Deck was great late afternoon to early evenings  mornings were too foggy  nothing to see. Rooms were clean  staff were very efficient and cordial.
pos,It was a nice place but it needs updating of rooms and amenities. They could have offered food selections native to the place.
neg,The noise next room to mine was extremely bad. you can hear every word they say and worse they were yelling at each other as if everyone was deaf. They also had their TV at a very loud level. The room we got had no noise absorber - we had a door in between. They slept late so we had to sleep laate as well and they woke up early - 5AM - and started making noise. Room 313 as poorly renovated for noise.
pos,good!!
pos,good food  comforting bed  accommodating staff
pos,Things that I like: -Accessible to the Skyranch -Good view of the Taal -Near a casino (even though I'm not a gambler) -Food was good  could add more options. -Great staff Things I didn't like: -Wifi in the room is BAD  in the lobby the connection is good. -Room looks old  well maintained but could add more features to compensate for the price. -Things are located far  so you tend to walk around more. For young people this is good but for older folks. -Not too accessible. If you have a private car-- great  if not :). Overall my stay was good  a bit pricey though so I expected more. I could get a lot more benefits staying at a hotel in Manila with that price. The buffet was good  doesn't have many options but the food is good. Should add more coffee stations to compensate with the crowd. The room looks old but well maintained. The AC was good or is it because the weather was cold  I don't know. More benefits for the room would do great. In this age  Wifi connectivity is a key  In our room It is very BAD. The complements in the room is a 3 in 1  I guess better than have nothing. The CR doesn't have a drain so If your a messy user water tends to gather  but with the great staff all is taken care of. The location is somewhat good  its near skyranch and has a good view of taal  so If you want to relax and recuperate its a good place to stay but you should watch out for the price :).
pos,The hotel is located in the great location. The view from our room was spectacular. Room is a bit too basic for what the money we paid for. Organic restaurant was superb in term of food quality and taste.
neg,Excellent stay  just a bit disappointed during check in took 1 1/2 to wait for the next available room  other guest who arrives late were able to checked in right away.
pos,It was wonderful  will be back for a family vacation
pos,We took a long weekend from Manila. The journey by road is around 2 hours. Check in and check out was effortless although they required a 4 000 peso deposit. The room we had was in the cliff wing with no view but I guess the more expensive rooms would have a stunning view. Unfortunately it rained for both of our days there so we were unable to take the boat trip to the volcanoes and hike up its side which is highly recommended. The food is excellent  the staff are obliging and friendly. All in all an excellent stay.
pos,Good environment and Fantastic scenery. The facilities are little bit old yet it is still good.
pos,Clean
neg,The bed was not comfortable. Noise is not filtered and you can hear noise from the hallway and in next rooms. the room looks old as well.
pos,stay was fine  My thoughts are that it is a 4 star hotel  however we did not dine there except for breakfast.
pos,We had a good stay here. Everything was good. The rooms are very comfortable and the service was great. The food was good. It was the conclusion to a very active 2 1/2 week vacation for us and it was nice to be in such a comfortable place for the last few nights.
pos,It was a comfortable stay that was close to places we had to visit for a quick weekend escape from the city. The view was as usually refreshing.
pos,We stayed for a night and got the exemplary service...The location was so good that you can just sit and gape at Taal volcano while waiting for sunset/sunrise...We'll definitely go back to Taal Vista...
pos,generally pleasant
pos,very relaxing staycation with my husband. we are able to have a quality time away from the busy life in the city. definitely we will comeback someday soon.
pos,Overall it's a very comfortable and relaxing stay. The hotel is well serviced and staff are all well trained.
pos,Awesome
pos,So far my stay in Taal Vista hotel with my family is ok  except the Pool VERY VERY COLD even at 1100am Lunch time.
pos,We were greeted by a friendly staff upon our checkin. What we especially liked about our stay was the early checkin since we were attending a wedding in the afternoon and we had to be inside our hotel room early to prep. Also  we were in the center of the commercial area which made it easier for us to get to restos  coffee shops and the like. The room was also spacious enough for an extra bed which made our stay very comfortable. The interior of the room assigned to us was also very modern.
pos,what I like about this hotel is that they have a big area where you can relax and overlooking the taal volcano and lake. I recommend this to my friends
pos,Aside from a couple of glitches like the power going off in the middle of the night  the hotel was pretty nice.
neg,"Impression that it is neither possible nor impossible. It was a toilet that was dissatisfied. As the sound is heard, there is resistance as a Japanese, but for Westerners and Filipinos it is a no problem?"
pos,We were actually checked in  in another hotel  for 2 nights  after the first night  we visited Taal Vista Hotel  we didn't have second thoughts  we went directly to the reception and booked for our second night  and after our second night  we booked our third night and enjoyed our stay.
pos,Staff were very accommodating.
pos,We have a great time staying in the hotel... I would recommend it to my friends!
pos,overall good  just a little pricey  and i hope all kids 7&below will still get to eat for free for breakfast with their parents. i have a 3&6 y/o kid and my 3 y/o only ate 1 pancake and hot choco. was not able to bring my 6/o along because we were told that we need to pay half the price which is almost P500. My 6.o also eats pancake and cereals only for breakfast. this would be best for a family. kids should eat free! aside from NYE  weve stayed at taal vista for x number of times. so i hope this suggestio will highly be taken inti consideration
pos,The resort location is truly amazing but the food quality and food service standards could be a lot better. Value for money  I did definitely not receive.
pos,"The location is good, the view from the hotel is superb. It is cheap compared to Manila."
pos,The breakfast buffet could be better but other than that there is nothing wrong to say about my stay. I love your gardens and the Weather was almost perfect. (. Weather is never perfect ). My family had a great time and we will surely be back!
pos,Very relaxing
pos,Great
pos,Improve water brand  change your beds and pillows to more comfortable ones!
neg,While Taal Vista has exceptional view and location  I suggest that Management must look into the details of its amenities and services. I notice that it uses substandard mineral water. Let us say that the quality of water is the same but the water bottle's packaging reflects the hotel's image. The plastic labeling is soft and comes off and the brand is known to be a cheap brand that we buy from street vendors. In addition  the hotel doesn't give priority to the comfort of its guests. The bed is not comfortable. It is so hard. The bed and the pillow have dust mites that caused my family and I to scratch our heads  neck a and backs throughout the night. Some members of my family stayed at another room and have the same feedback. I didn't get to sleep at night because of these. Hotel beds and pillows are of utmost importance as they are supposed to guarantee to guests that even if they are away from home  they would feel at home at your hotel. When I called for assistance to have the lamp checked  I had to follow up for someone to come after an hour.
pos,Great
pos,Good rest and location
pos,There were some inconveniences like..the bathroom has no door  the sliding door lock going out to the patio is not done properly  sound insulation also needs improvement since we can hear children running from the room above us.But in general  but our stay is quite ok.
pos,Our stay in Taal Vista Hotel was quite relaxing and refreshing  except for some room facilities and/or surroundings that need to be improved. Outside venues like at the lobby and breakfast area were just awesome. We've enjoyed listening to the Christmas carol and folk-song/classical singers at the lobby  and having our breakfast full of good/delicious food while watching the serenity of Taal lake. Thumbs up! Anyway  when it came to the room facilities  they're quite old already needing renovation. There isn't any bidet installed (5-star hotels normally have bidets) to the disappointment of bidet users. Sliding doors were stucked up  and shower heads were not that easy to control with sprayed water stream not quite comfortable or skin-friendly. The mountain side view surroundings were not well maintained as there were tall cogon grasses blocking the mountain view. Well  the staff are friendly  courteous and accommodating.
pos,Hotel is okey. It's the trip to the hotel where traffic was at its worst.
pos,Overall the hotel staff accommodation and facilities is very very good.
pos,My family expected the amenities and appearance of a 5-star hotel. Instead  we were shocked to see a room with dirty tiles  a weak aircon and furnishings and interiors worthy of an old apartment. we expected a simple but elegant filipiniana designed hotel. thank God for the view and the cool weather.
pos,It was ok pretty average nothing wow compared to our visit in 2009
pos,Its our first time here and we enjoy our stay. Room are very clean  very comfortable and very good food. Definitely we will come back here.
pos,Superb
pos,I love the staff  they very friendly and efficient.
pos,Very satisfied...we were relaxed and had great family bonding...will surely recommend the hotel to friends and relatives.
pos,nice
pos,It was wonderful  the kids enjoyed
pos,A great chill out place slightly expensive but a good quality hotel  Room in the new wing was comfortable new and clean. Great views from the restaurant and gardens
pos,Third time here. Not a bargain but one of the nicer hotels in Tagaytay
pos,Check-in was very quick. Staff was generally helpful. Room had high ceilings  floor to ceiling windows  and a veranda overlooking the lake. Bed linens were very comfortable.
pos,Got a room overlooking the Taal volcano. Kinda long walk to the room location otherwise it's alright. Security is good. Food offered in the buffet is good as well.
pos,everything went well except when we checked in it took them (housekeeping) more than an hour just to set up the bed we are to attend a wedding at 4 pm and decided to stay in taal vista for convenience and at the same time  for relaxation we went there at 1:30pm confirmation at 1:52pm but got the room  few minutes after 3pm the check out procedure was okay  but they missed to see that we left an item inside the hotel room  but honest enough when we asked if we left anything inside.
neg,I thought it was horrible. We arrived 30mins before check in. Kids and wife were so excited. We were told the room would be ready in a few mins only to learn after 2 hours that it was not ready. Worst  nobody informed us. I had to do follow-up every 30mins. Wife was so angry but I was able to manage her anger. Rooms are overrated I guess. You're paying 8k for a superior room that is not carpeted (just tiles). Choice of food at the buffet breakfast is very limited. Anyway  the kids enjoyed the rides at skyranch - the only reason why we chose Taal Vista.
pos,Very relaxing especially after terrible 2-hour traffic starting from Nuvali Sta. Rosa up to Taal Vista. Would recommend to travel early morning especially on long weekends.
pos,The view was fantastic  plain and simple. The Skypark was off to the side so it never blocked the view of the lake. Room was very spacious  food from room service and breakfast buffet was delicious. Here's a tip: Don't be afraid to order from the kids menu for room service as the serving was for a regular adult. I highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Tagaytay!
pos,My stay was superb  imagine drinking coffee at the lobby while listening to old school Christmas songs by Tony Benet  Nat King Cole and the likes....Food is superb  although room service can still improve. There is this warm Christmassy feeling all over the hotel...will bring the family there this Christmas
pos,Great!
pos,We are satisfied with our stay.
pos,Very relaxing  would go back again next time
pos,happy
pos,Very nice. We really loved it
pos,The best stay i had so far... Staffs greet you everytime they see you. Breakfast is amazing buffet type You can get massage too.
pos,The Taal Vista offered a fantastic view  excellent amenities and a great location in Tagaytay...
pos,Rooms were clean and very comfortable. Food was excellent! The fresh air of the area breezed the New Year in! A nice place to rekindle the spirit for the new year!
neg,it was ok  but very disappointed with our room--- they use white lights on all the lamps  we had a connecting room with our kids and their room has warm lights
pos,Good
pos,Our stay here was very nice especially since they gave us the best/highest room with the best view at a short notice. But I guess what they should add is having a set of utensils (spoon  fork  and/or knife) ready in the room. Other than that  I'll say that our overnight here was very satisfying and I believe it is still one of the best hotels in Tagaytay.
pos,Memorable
pos,Feel good and comfortable for staying
neg,Not that great a hotel  definitely not 5 star. The room was very basic and did not seem to be that clean. The concierge will only book you transport through the hotels Avis facility which is very overpriced. The bar shuts at 11 which isn't that great if you want to chill out after a long day. When we got to our room after dinner the bed and room was covered in ants  as it was midnight we didn't want to swap rooms so had to stick it out  we were bitten alive throughout the night. When we mentioned to the manager we were offered a late check out the next time we stayed as a goodwill gesture  this is not really acceptable. Breakfast in the morning was reasonable  good selection  service not that great though  have to keep asking for coffee refills etc which I have never experienced in a 5 star hotel before. The hotel is okay  but for what you pay I would expect allot better  especially as the hotel is outside of town so you are relatively limited to where you can go.
pos,Perfect.
neg,Good but not what i expected.
pos,Good
pos,It was a great experience staying in the hotel  very relaxing place because it is very spacious  clean  has friendly and accomodating staff  and the fresh Air that is therapeutic for me. If i want to be free from stressful environment its the best place to stay for a while.
pos,It was the best hotel we stayed in
pos,I visit Tagaytay often but rarely I get a chance to splurge in one of the luxury hotel that the place has to offer. I can say that if luxury/ pampering is your priority you can definitely choose this type of hotel. I get to stay in the Premier Lake king because I want to have a view of Taal lake. They also have a mountain wing rooms where the swimming pool is located. Breakfast is buffet style and I can say that the selection of food is quite okay. It is located in front of Casino Filipino and beside Sky Ranch. If you choose the Lake room areas  you can view the big ferris wheel in your private balcony and you hear the screaming people in the area. But you don't have to worry about the noise  once in your room you can't hear the screaming in the sky ranch area. If you don't have a private vehicle like me  there is a jeepney that pass by in the area ( Casino Highway) coming from Our Lady of Lourdes Church. I am recommending this hotel if you have a budget to splurge and get the Lake rooms.
pos,I'd definitely go back to this hotel and it's my preferred place to stay whenever I need to go to Tagaytay to attend events in Tagaytay.
pos,The staff was exceptional helpful. Edwin M. at the consierge desk went above and beyond is helping find transportation for a large group to go to matabungkay beach and finding a local jeweler to fix a piece of jewelry..Always get the lake view... visit mid week if your looking for the solitude.. Loved our visit Thank you Marvin P.
neg,The total experience should had been wonderful if the room was comfortable for us but my sons complaint of the aircondition unit was not functioning so we open the window  the toilet doesnt have badae and a bit small compare to other hotels. Good thing the breakfast was perfect  nice ambiance and accomodating staffs. If i will be ask to come again  my answer will be  no thank you.
pos,We will definitely return.
pos,Restful and comfortable
pos,Nice view old furniture also bathroom need renovation. Nice swimming pool&garden.
neg,Bad! There were checkings made to the room 2 hrs after checking in. Knocking and even forcing open the door was done. There were 2 attempts. 2 hrs after  a phone call was received to check on guest  which after query was replied to it being standard. Hotel guests are supposed to have good  Undisturbed and well rested stay. Noise out in the hallways and even from the other nearby rooms fails the STC (sound transmission coefficient).
neg,it was good..they just can't serve coffee that afternoon because it was inoperative according to the attendant at the lobby. I think they should have spare brewer.
pos,Its so nice the staff are all good.
pos,Excellent!
pos,Great  we enjoyed a lot
neg,It was a fund family bonding experience  but our car got minor bump on infront while parked at the basement parking area :(
pos,The room was clean as to be expected in a 5 star hotel. I needed to obtain some simple medicine and the hotel even had a free clinic. This was a very enjoyable stay in a lovely location.
pos,I highly recommend taal vista. We have been going back since i was a kid. Sm did a very good job maintaining it. Staffs are very professional football
pos,need to schedule another time to stay at Taal Vista Hotel at least a week next time
pos,We had a great time... We will bring the kids nxt time.
neg,good sleep but pricing for normal day should be more cheaper. nothing to enjoy in the hotel except the nice view.
neg,The hotel is over rated frt desk needs to be trained  on check out they ask me if i got something from the inroom bar told them no after that she called somebody to check the room why ask me in the first place if shes gonna ask somebody to check the waist of time
pos,Great relaxing stay!
pos,Awesome
pos,Overall  the stay has been really wonderful. The place was great and its location is perfect. Their staff has been very helpful as well. Opportunities for improvement include the location of their garden rooms. The garden is quite not really a garden. Their restroom could also be improved a bit. Lastly  their fitness gym needs a significant improvement.
pos,Very nice place to unwind during holidays....
pos,Good! very relaxing... good for breakaway and unwind...
pos,It was good. Second time there.
pos,Great stay!
pos,We checked in at 4am by Sheena. She was wearing her gorgeous and welcoming smile that early. I explained to her that it was a last minute booking and I wasn't able to book the previous night. She gladly offered an early check in with a fee and discounted breakfast as well. That was a very nice gesture as she noticed that we were all tired from the long drive and wanted to rest. No bellman assisted us to our room which is actually located at the other end of the hotel overlooking the volcano. The room was clean and spacious. The high ceiling and the balcony made the call. However  the name written on the welcome card was wrong  maybe due to the early check in. Would actually expect some 5-star toilet amenities but it was a disappointment to see their own brand that doesn't lather much and not fragrant at all. Mouthwash would have been a good addition too. Buffet breakfast was excellent I must say. Good varieties of Filipino dishes too. Staff at Cafe Veranda were all smiling and always willing to assist. Someone even helped me bring my plate on the table. Highly recommended.
pos,Very Good
pos,WE had another good stay and Taal Vista Hotel. We find the restaurant  like a lot of other hotels  expensive with average food. Lots of great restaurants outside in town along the main road. The room this time looked like it needed refurbishing. An ok hotel to stay at.
pos,Very relax  easy stay
pos,The hotel has excellent can do staff and management  the lounges and restaurant areas are beautifully decorated and there is a peaceful ambiance throughout. It is a true escape from the usual hustle bustle of any township or city and traffic in the Philippines affording real isolation and relaxation. Yet the hotel is only a few short km to Olivarez and 30 minutes from the departure points for a trip on the lake and to Taal Volcano. Rooms were very comfortable. Its a great hotel and environment but be warned  the room rate is expensive: AU $350 - $450 per night  more if you want a balcony view. There was a Agoda promo running for $170 / night and we stayed there 4 nights. It was on this stay we became engaged. A worthy hotel of five stars.
pos,ok. not bad
pos,Our stay was wonderful.
pos,We only stayed two nites and by nature am hard to please so me giving this hotel a 5 star says a lot about their hotel .lot of hotels claim to be a 4or5 star but don't live up to it this one does
neg,Good ! Not great !
neg,Great service between the hotel staff and the restaurant. The rooms were so-so. Stayed in the new wing. We saw bugs on more than one occasion. Also  the shower head needs to be replaced in room 460. It's clogged so only half of it is working.
pos,It was a great stay  the staff were very nice
pos,The hotel is clean with friendly and accommodating Staff. The food is okay as well as the weather.
pos,Pleasant weekend spent at the hotel  nice grounds and view. Hotel condition is a little worn and not always very clean. The staff was vary helpful and professional.
pos,Good Food and Value for Money!
pos,We had a fantastic stay here. We need not go somewhere else. Place was awesome and clean. Staffs are very polite and helpful. 1. Cygnal cable was always out of signal. 2. At the reception  when i asked if we can have the room with a nice view. They didnt inform me beforehand how much it would cost. They just went ahead and prepared the upgrade and i didnt have the chance to backout. But  all in all. T'was a relaxing stay. TYVM .
pos,Since I was a kid I go to this place I like going to this place however when I went this time everything was alright but when I was about to sleep I found a bag of rock salt under the sheets. I complained and everything alright after that
pos,Awesome
pos,excellent weekend stay. will definitely go back.
neg,without a word  was given a handicap room. you can tell from the bathroom configuration...shower curtain instead of real shower screen/door  hand rails everywhere including a vertical pole 2 feet in front of toilet bowl! the layout did not allow a vanity top so we had to stack our toiletries precariously on the water closet. We know we had a handicap room because we peeped into our neighbours' rooms and they looked normal. Breakfast was a dissapointment too. I've enjoyed much better quality and selection in 3 star hotels. We decided to skip breakfast after 1 morning. This hotel probably sells for its view only. But if you dont get a room with a view  try somewhere else.
pos,As what I say.... Great hotel. Very good place and location. Beautiful view. Nice and attentive staff. Delicious food. Very comfortable to stay. Nothing I can say... It's a great hotel.. Fantastic! Come back again
neg,Comfortable but again they need to improve the food quality (breakfast)  attentiveness of their staff (front desk/restaurant)  quality of their elevators and other infrastructures.
pos,Stayed overnight at two deluxe rooms with my husband and kids to celebrate our anniversary and father's day. Check in was swift and efficient. Staff very helpful. Rooms were clean and well-stocked. Housekeeping ready to resupply the room with additional towels and toiletries. Had breakfast at Cafe Veranda. Selection was great and even if the hotel was full  we didn't have to wait for a table for a long time. Lots of activities at the hotel like bubbles at the view deck  swimming. The lifeguard at the pool area was especially helpful to guests. The hotel location can't be beat. Close to the numerous restaurants in Tagaytay City should you prefer to dine outside the hotel. And it's right beside Sky Ranch so best hotel to stay at for those with children. Will definitely be back!
pos,You will look forward of staying again in your future travels in Tagaytay.
neg,i was over charge for my massage   it was suppose to be 1650 peso upon checking out it was 13 850 peso. I tried to get it rectified but to no avail.
pos,Good
pos,Relaxing 
pos,Stayed with my wife and daughter for a long weekend. Nice hotel  clean rooms  great staff  good location. Food can be better.
pos,Very good experience that's why I return back to the same hotel
pos,Their swimming is too small for that big of a hotel. Furthermore  the taste of their brewed coffee is too bland  not a five star material. But by the end of the day  it is still one of the best in tagaytay.
neg,Please put seat bidet or hand bidet in the watercloset for hygienic purposes.
pos,Was alright! Relaxed and rejuvenating. First and foremost staying on the ridge overlooking the taal was brilliant... just a few things I think the hotel can do better is to have a better spread for breakfast for vegetarians  pay attention to droplets leaking from the aircon inside the room and few staff during breakfast who didnt do a good job in taking our requests to completion. Else rest was pleasant as an experience
pos,very good  very relaxing
pos,Very enjoyable stay  good room  great views from The Lake Wing balconies and the grounds in general  overall a good hotel
pos,Excellent
neg,I set the bar real low so I won't be disappointed.
pos,There were enough amenities for everyone in the family to enjoy. The rooms were a bit old but the hot water in the shower was good and their food was  too.
pos,Second stay at Taal Vista and good again. Big hotel so can become crowded at times. Breakfast was a bit crazy as so many people all helping themselves at the same time. Really need to extend the restaurant or build another restaurant to fit everyone in.
pos,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. Only issue is room is somehow not noise proof as you can hear people talking on walkways near the rooms. Very nice view of Taal and the location is located strategically near tour establishments. Very huge room with complete amenities.
pos,It was good.front desk employee excellent service. When someone check our to they did not fix our bed.
pos,My family enjoyed our stay at the hotel. We were able to do a lot of kid-friendly activities inside & outside the hotel. The staff were very attentive and accomodating. I just wanted to ask the management if they could have the pool heated during the cool season from Dec-Feb.
pos,It was perfect. My birthday celebration with my family was worthy. We enjoyed everything  the view of the taal was relaxing  the kids corner made my sons experience fantastic. The food was great! Very happy with our stay.
pos,Room and staff are nice. Overlooking of taal volcano and garden is nice to relax. It's so calm and quiet.
pos,Our room was located in the mountain view  however  we dont have a view of the mountain  nevertheless  we were able to see the taal lake in the morning we had our breakfast  food was great. Pool was great as well  problem is its close around 8 pm..
pos,Awesome as always! I make sure I stay a couple of weekends every year at this hotel. Very private and does not feel cramped even during special occasions.
pos,We stayed at this hotel for 3 days and 2 nights. Has great view of the Taal lake. Good location  walking distance from the Sky Ranch if you want to go there. Staff is very accommodating. Hotel room is cozy. Breakfast buffet was a let down  didn't have much variety. Tried the Taza Fresh Table restaurant  food was just ok given the high ratings and good reviews from bloggers. I like the hotel but it doesn't have the wow factor of a 5 star hotel..
pos,Taal Vista has always been a favorite of ours whenever we visit Tagaytay. The rooms at their Lake Wing were new and good. Food is OK but I found their menu a bit limited  so the buffet could be recommended. The staff are amazing though. They immediately attend to the needs of the guests.
pos,relatively okay
pos,I enjoyed our stay. My parents enjoyed the food and the room. Will go back next time.
pos,Superb. Staffs are friendly  food is delicious  the hotel is clean
pos,it was relaxing and fun
pos,Perfect for vacation.
pos,Had a pleasant stay In this hotel  my mother who uses a wheelchair was well taken care of. The staff/ tall man (didn't get his name) was so helpful helping us taking my mom to the room  cafe veranda etc. thank you we will be back.
neg,Buffet breakfast lacks variety
pos,Taal Vista Hotel is perfect for families with young kids along with the older family members. I love that they provided free wheelchair to my grandmother the whole duration of our stay. Wide-Open spaces with amazing view of Taal volcano (other side has view of the mountains which is also just as breath-taking).
pos,As always  once you checked in  the last thing on your mind is to check out. Relaxing and comforting.
pos,It was a great stay. My family and I enjoyed the swimming pool  the buffet breakfast. It is accessible . Waling distance to the ranch  the casino and few minutes drives to mahogany market. Staff members are accomodating and helpful. Will definitely stay again in this hotel.
pos,Great!
pos,My wife and I stayed at the Taal Vista over the Easter week end and had a delightful stay. The staff are courteous and friendly  the food was good  and the rooms spacious and comfortable.The hotel itself is quite sprawling so easy to get lost until you know your way around. The view is outstanding  just pray for good weather so you get to enjoy it at it's best. The only negative I will mention is that the rooms were overpriced. Perhaps they were just cashing in on Easter  but we paid roughly double what we would normally pay for a hotel of this standard  Easter weekend notwithstanding. I would rate the hotel as 4 star  not 5 star. But all in all  a very enjoyable weekend.
pos,it was generally pleasant
neg,stay is just average
pos,very comfortable
pos,Its a great vacation  we stayed to celebrate my husband's bday  and its a blast. Very near skyranch.
neg,We checked in at 11pm  only 1 staff was in the front desk. After 10 minutes  he called help fr another who was just inside the room adjacent to the front desk  seemingly chatting with another staff. And for a very nice hotel  the staff seem very lax and would talk loud and laugh loud. I think that's an area of improvement
pos,Very good
pos,Great but the only thing I saw for a five star is some old and very unprofessional repairs to fixtures tiles in the elevator cracked and broken
pos,Very good
pos,Our stay was awesome. we have fun staying on this hotel and we are recommending this hotel other people.
pos,our stay in this hotel was so good. from the reception desk  to room service & the b'fast buffet.
pos,This is the 2nd time we stayed here and we always enjoy staying here because of the location and the music lounge with singer and pianist so relaxing and also the dessert cupcakes and cakes but some staff should trained well in assisting there clients properly but the rest of the staff is OK :)
pos,Pretty good
pos,It was great!
neg,The last time I stayed in this hotel was back in the 90's and from what I remember the new management had improved the hotel quite a lot in terms of dining facilities and facilities. I believe some rooms were already renovated  but we were assigned in one of the older wings hence it was obvious that the room (although quite clean) was rundown already and overdue for an upgrade. We had dinner in the hotel but the food was so-so  to think they had an event for visiting chefs. Breakfast was bountiful but nothing really special. Given the price vs. competition in the area  I expected more in general.
pos,Good stay
pos,Kids enjoyed and want to go back
pos,Our stay in Taal vista was good as usual. Although we had a problem with lunch where in when we arrived  the restaurant was all reserved and the only place we went to was the lobby lounge where they didnt serve full meals. However  our stay was great and the rooms were nice. Taal vista will always be one of my favorite places to stay in Tagaytay.
pos,it was amazing. The staff is very helpful & friendly. The breakfast is good. The view & the weather is perfect for celebrating your anniversary.
neg,not sa bad but it could have been better as their price is high
neg,Disappointed
pos,A relaxing one!
pos,it was a very relaxing stay and was able to enjoy it with the family. thank you
neg,We wanted to have 2 rooms with king beds  but one of them with an additional bed. Front desk had to give us 4 different rooms until they accomplished such simple request. Later on  we had to complain because they room with an additional bed had only a bed  but not extra toiletries  slippers  breakfast  etc. In general  it was a pleasant stay  but the front desk clearly could be a much better job understanding the customer requests and checking that everything is done correctly.
neg,Love the food  the views and the staffs...but so costly!!!
pos,Very nice time. Staff is excellent and very attentive. The Sunday lunch buffet/native dancing show was terrific!! Very enjoyable! Would stay here again.
neg,My stay in Taal vista was overall okay. However  Im really disspaointed with their breakfast buffet. The foods are cold  the staffs are not that accomodating.
pos,Quite relaxing
pos,It was a pleasant weekend  a bit rainy but we sure have a long rest away from busy city and with a nice view.
neg,We checked in  and our driver left. We then found out we were staying in a different wing so had to get our driver back. The room was plain and featureless  and it smelled of cigarette smoke. When you compare this with 5 star hotels in Manila  it doesn't match. 4 star  maximum. The menu was very limited. Fairly dull. And they delivered the cold toast in the morning with no butter. Sorry  but that's not 5 star standard. And it was expensive for what it was. We will not be back.
pos,good
neg,Location is good  But anything managed by SM is cheap. Even free items in the room  such as soap and toothbrush you have to call 3-4 times for them to bring. Food very good and low quality. Rooms worth 2000 pesos only. In general what you see at SM you see in this hotel
pos,Very nice
pos,I have been in Tall Vista Hotel many times but mostly for our business conferences. But this time i went (as a couple) in order to relax and just re-ignite. And that we did - being beautiful with the view overlooking Taal Volcano and knowing that its dormant but not extinct. I guess seeing nature in its verdant form gave us also an inner glimpse of our barest souls.
pos,Great
pos,just like last year  we enjoyed our stay in the hotel. staff were nice and accomodating. we always look forward watching the fireworks that even rain poured as we welcome the new year  we enjoyed watching those amazing fireworks even were getting wet due to the rain
pos,great!
pos,it's a beautiful hotel. stayed for a week. you can stay inside the compound if you are there with family. lounge facility is excellent. staffs are very caring and always smiling. best part is the value for money. will go back again if i am in tagaytay.
pos,amazingly superb!
neg,Very disappointing. I dont think it was worth what I paid for it.
pos,our stay is very good. though we only stayed for one night. we should have stayed more if the time permitted  so we can explore more of the amenities. we like the live music at the lounge  very entertaining. Everything is good. we will come back again in this hotel
pos,Excellent   will come back
neg,we had a nice stay there. the view is awesome. the room have a nice balcony and spcious. breakfast not so many choice. i would rate the breakfast not more than 3 star hotel.
neg,It Was good nice room but a bit expensive for the room type.
pos,i enjoyed our stay  i will surely go back
pos,Relaxing
neg,for a five star hotel  our room sink is leaking. This was reported to front desk upon checkout. Traffic during holidays is terrible  avoid going there on long weekends and holidays.
pos,We enjoyed it.
pos,staff very nice... great view... super location
pos,The employees are well oriented and hospitable. Two thumbs up! :)
neg,I stayed at the most expensive suite available at the hotel since it is the only one available when I requested for an upgrade. unfortunately  the aircon at the master's bedroom is not working and the staff couldn't do anything on our 3 day stay. they offered some discount on my return as a consolation  that is if I ever go back to this low quality hotel!!!
pos,Excellent
neg,We have a fine stay  although the beds are quite small and the room given to us has no view as it is the outermost room on the mountain wing  its comfort room has no lock and the wooden post in it shows that it is old merely retrofitted. Room 334. Nevertheless  I enjoyed the classical music and wine at the Lobby Lounge which also had a fireplace. We were also able to jog in t3 sky view deck during the early which is eindy & considerably cool.
neg,Overall satisfactory but not great.
neg,The best location and view in Tagaytay. My kids love the walking distance to Skyrach. The food (breakfast) was not for a five star hotel standard and pricey.
neg,Staff and location of the hotel is nice. Our room has no view but the view outside was great. on our room the bathroom was kinda open with a weak exhaust. Kinda expensive imho.
pos,Very pleasant stay.
neg,It was ok basically except for the towels which looks old and worn out
neg,Very disappointing.
pos,Great
neg,Not sa bad but it could have been better as their price is high
pos,Best
neg,our room shower facility was clogged. Informed front desk upon check out  don't know what action was taken.
neg,Food choices so limited and kept on repeating menu  diner staff not alert  tables not prepared well  so long wait for orders
pos,Excellent  we always spent Christmas in this hotel  will come back again !
pos,Quite good
pos,Amazing stay!
pos,Our stay at Taal Vista was very relaxing. The staff are friendly. We'll definitely go back here.
pos,This has been renovated so the rooms are very comfortable and the restaurant is cozy. It is centrally located and has a nice pool and a very large garden. The views are perfect for picture-taking.
pos,Best hotel stay in my short trip in Philippines
pos,Very nice
pos,Warm  comfortable and a welcoming retreat from the busy city life.
neg,It's was pleasant but breakfast of 3 star
pos,Superb.
neg,If you are coming to Tagaytay for the view - this is the perfect place. The lake is stunning  and the view from the deck is amazing of the volcano and surrounding area. The hotel is right next to an amusement park - a bit of a wild place  but fun for the family. The hotel has a beautiful lobby and bar area  and the pool is cute and nice. Our room had dirty floors  the tub was not great  mirrors had not been cleaned in a long time  and overall  not 5 stay quality. The lobby is 5 star while the room is much closer to a 2 star room. Our dinner was pretty bad and while we did enjoy most of the breakfast food  the plates and trays at the buffet were often empty for long periods of time. The dining room was chaos during breakfast - more staff and more efficient staff are needed. My advice would be to find a small hotel in the area and get a more intimate experience and skip the Taal Vista.
pos,it was fun
pos,We had fun! A must try!
pos,GReat experience!
pos,Great taal lake view
neg,The stay was very satisfying. There were occasions though when other guests tend to forget that there were other guests staying in the hotel. Our first night was almost a fiasco with guests staying right above our room constantly trampling around their room. This was remedied though with prompt response to our request for change of room. In the new room though  defects continued to hound us with a dripping aircondition and a safe with weak batteries. The response to these complaints were prompt and remedies done were satisfactory. Then on our penultimate day  cleaning was haphazardly done with coffee mugs left unwashed and floor left improperly mopped.
neg,The deluxe rooms have ceramic floor tiles that give it a cheap feel. Toilet furnishings are minimal and budget hotel standard  but they price themselves 5 stars. Breakfast buffet spread limited  and the staff are too busy to clear tables to provide service standards expected from a 5 star hotel. Kids play room is a pathetic little room with minimal toys or books. Nothing here is near 4 star let alone 5 stars
pos,Had a lovely  will definitely return
neg,The location and view from the premier lake room can't be beat. Staff is very courteous and friendly. Spa is good though expensive. However  condition  cleanliness and food choices need to be upgraded.
pos,Everything is just perfect! From the rooms to the food up to the staff! Definitely going back! Cheers Taal Vista! :)
pos,Excellent! Would definitely come back.
neg,Although they rate themselves as 5 star we feel they are overrating themselves knowing that most of their facilities are outdated. The price is too high for everything they offer.
pos,Excellent
pos,The staff is great they are very friendly and very hospitable. We have also tried the spa which I recomend. We had I good experience with it. Plus the food is another great experience. Overall I recommend this hotel.
neg,average and was disappointed as our first day and at 7am was woken-up by a loud music playing outside garden with no consiseration to their guests still asleep. Complained to the front desk but nothing happened not even apology.. Overall will not stay again
pos,"Taal Vista is a hotel with a lot of history. The location is unique and the pictures and history are fascinating to read. The view is brilliant, but you do not have to stay in the hotel. Our room was upgraded room had noppes view, and work going on. The pool is a swimming pool, nothing special. Breakfast is a habit. The lobby is stylish and classic. Beautiful view for coffee with piece of cake. The complete massage in the spa was very nice. It smelled a bit muffy in the room, but in the evening it's lovely to sit outside in the coolness. But that can be anywhere else too. Personally, I would like to have a drink or a drink with a view of Language Volcano. Overnight stays can be better done for the money. But for a night it was good to do it. There are many conferences and meetings in the hotel VAT."
neg,The room we got is old and a long walk from the lobby  restaurant  and parking area! Walk  walk  walk!
neg,it was ok  what was disappointing though was that i booked two rooms and we were assigned to 2 different floors. front office management should anticipate the needs of families.
pos,Comfortable and relaxed
neg,The room was spacious and comfortable. I would have wished that the door would offer more privacy since i can hear footsteps and noise coming from the corridor. Also  pls install bidet in all your water closets. Much thanks for the warm service.
neg,I expected too high  so was disappointed. Staff not very efficient. Food was too sweet for my taste. Does not seem to be worth the money.
pos,Nice and relaxing. The food is also good and they provide a lot of choices.
pos,Nice hotel with a great view. The only problem was that we were locked out of our room and I had to walk all the way to the front desk to have the key reset.
pos,good view  friendly staff  near entertainment areas
pos,We love the hotel  the staff  the food and the location. We will definitely stay here again
pos,Lovely  cool stay at the Batangas suite and premier rooms for our family of 6. Parking was big and generous  same as lobby and sitting areas. Reception  porter and waiters were so attentive to our needs. Even at the breakfast room  plates were cleared swiftly. The simple furnishings of the place does not overshadow the hotel's biggest selling point  the VIEW. No amount of expensive or grand adornment can rival what it naturally has. Just one minor suggestion  we hope reception guides where to park depending on room location considering its such a long building and has 2 lobbies and underground parking. People with walking problems have to alight near their rooms.
pos,Short but pleasant stay at the hotel. The airconditioning unit could use some improvement though and the luggage service took a while as we were checking out but the very helpful bellboy made up for it anyway.
neg,We stayed in an old wing. Far from lobby. Main complaint was that walls were paper thin. Could here the people in the room next to me watching TV at 1am!
pos,I love it and will def come again!
neg,Had they not found an early 8a.m available room we would have gone elsewhere despite our room prepayment. Service is slow.
pos,Terrific
pos,Nice staff  good food. Good to be here.
pos,Had a great time and even when the hotel was crowded with events  they make it a point to find parking for hotel guests. It was beside the SkyRanch so we just walked over and had a fun weekend...
pos,Awesome. Great food. The kids enjoyed the place. Awesome!!!
neg,Had a good stay but this hotel is in need of an upgrade. Our room had a gross stain on the main light shade in the room. I had to cover it with a towel so I didnt have to see it while in the room. Breakfast is just ok. Many of the hot items are not so hot. Nobody likes cold waffles  pancakes  or bacon. I found it odd that the toilet had no spray washer for all the local filipinos. Maybe a little overpriced.
neg,We tried the promo online that's why we got the Mountain View room. We didn't expect it to be that old and it seems that it was not well-maintained. The bathroom looks old and the smell was not so good. We also didn't like the furnishings. It's like we're not in Taal Vista at all.
pos,I like it. Hopefully will come Bach soonest
pos,Great experience! Stayed in a premier room  i suggest that mgt. trim the tall trees since it obstructed our view from the 3rd floor.
neg,The room we got was at the old building. Not satisfied with the room  bathroom looks filthy. They need to renovate asap.
pos,the stay was pleasant  was able to re-charge from a very busy week.
pos,we had so much fun  enjoy the view and the friendly staff are great.
pos,overall stay was ok although rooms were a bit rusty... we appreciate their effort in giving us adjoining rooms since we were with our kids...

pos,My husband and I stay in Taal Vista at least once per quarter. The staff are great. And overall experience is satisfactory.
pos,Fair
neg,I am requesting a refund from the manager. For two nights we have stayed we have experienced noise coming from the ceiling which we believe that was caused by rats. But since I purchased the booking from agoda they said cant refund  and would take by 4 weeks to process from agoda. It is a bad experience waste of time  could have spent it somewhere else.
neg,It was okay  i didnt like the fact that the hotel lobby was full of people attending various events happening at the same time - weddings  sales conventiom  etc.
pos,Sulit ang presyo!
pos,The hotel is just located beside the Taal lake and have great view. The room is spacious and comfortable. The staff are very friendly. There is also a casino opposite the hotel if you want to try your luck.
pos,very nice environment
pos,It was a great stay there and the view was so attractive and cooling
neg,everything was ok..except for the beds !! their to hard not comfortable for sleeping
pos,Ive been to taal vista several times and it is our only choice of hotel to stay in tagaytay because of its ambiance and very relaxing surroundings. Perfect place if you want to get out of the city and have a breathe of fresh air
pos,It was great! Our kids had so much fun.
pos,Very good stay  travel arrangements perfect  pool water was very cold. Breakfast was very good  staff cute and friendly  we would stay there again  restaurant staff arranged a perfect engagement dinner  thank you
neg,Best part is the view. Hotel is located at the top of the road down to the Taal Boat ride docks and beaches  bisects the main road that connects all life in Tagaytay. Close enough  but also far enough away from the crowds at Summit Ridge and the second roundabout. Buffet breakfast was good  but room is crowded/noisy when busy. Dinner on Friday nights is expensive but best in town. Rooms remodeled still have a classic feel  though the remodeling is still ongoing. Covered walkway connecting the main building and the mountain wing is gone  so when it rains  one cannot walk without an umbrella even within the hotel. Example: walking to dinner or wedding - going to get a little bit wet unless you have an umbrella  and you will have to carry the umbrella around with you - no umbrella stand. In the room: no clothes hangers on closet left side makes it unusable. No robes in room  just slippers. Noise passes easily through the adjacent room doors; easily fixed with some soundproofing. Passed these notes to the GM  and we will see on our next stay at Taal Vista next year.
pos,it was good.. room is so big for couple
pos,It was quite good.
pos,In general  the stay was superb. The room was very clean  has free and strong wifi and big. Staff was very polite and helpful and the location of the hotel is perfect. However  the breakfast buffet was not very good  its too expensive considering the food selection and taste.
pos,great. pool closed too early
pos,Fair
pos,Relax to the max
pos,It was always a pleasant stay at Taal Vista Hotel. But the carpets need refurbishing. They are old like two star dinghy hotels. But overall  our stay was relaxing and comfortable. We always come back here.
pos,During our stay at the hotel  we have a relaxing moments because of the wonders of the cultural heritage while we enjoy a sumptuous lunch. The Dance Group delighted us as they perform beautifully their choreographed cultural presentations. We also visit The Kultura Butik that sells Filipino gift and souvenir items. We enjoyed the amazing scenery from the View Deck. We also enjoyed watching and hearing piano music and the scheduled group singer at night at the hotel lobby.
pos,Stay was satisfactory; Shuttle Van needs improvement
neg,It was nice though it wasn't best one to stay Swimming pool is very poor... Compare to the reputation of the hotel. Room view was very limited so be sure when u book u need to choose best site to stay
pos,Come here for the ninth time blessed to find a wonderful rest
pos,I go there every time I am in tagaytay
neg,over all is okay but disappointed because the room is dirty and the smell is not nice. its noisy cos its closed to the restaurant. The staff are friendly tha makes a lot difference.
pos,Great stay though brief. Just overnight but good enough to feel the serenity and peace and enjoy the panoramic view from our room's balcony. I will come again with family.
pos,Fantastic
neg,Not good  constantly trying to upgrade us  charged for a mini bar we did not even know was in the room. Predatory up sell on room. Would not recommend.
neg,Because of the events in the halls  our room was incredibly noisy until midnight...
neg,Cable intermittent. Aircon not working. Slow response of Engineering team
pos,The best customer service I've ever had so far. Keep it up! 
pos,We had a great stay as usual! They never fail.
pos,it was very memorable because i had my wedding on tagaytay
pos,Nice and Pleasant
pos,nice hotel. stayed at the lake wing. room was big and comfy. wifi signal was weak where i stayed. overall would come back again.
neg,The hotel boasts of superb facilities and excellent location but when we arrived at the hotel it's facilities were very standard  definitely not what we had expected. We did appreciate the location though.
pos,It was great... spent time with my hubby and kids. Also enjoyed being with my siblings and their families.
pos,The staff is very attentive to your needs
pos,very good! highly recommend it!
pos,Very good. Wish we could stay longer!
pos,The stay was great considering the location with the Taal lake view!
pos,although they had suffered some typhoon damage it was business as usual and a very pleasant stay which was our second visit in two years
pos,Perfect!
neg,We only stay for a night and lucky for us because it's toilet didn't occupied with water hose. I cannot imagine for people who never wash their back side after take a dump. So gross.
pos,It was my second time to stay at this hotel and as the first time  I enjoyed my stay with family here. The rooms are big and the view of Mt. Taal from here is great. It's also close to Sky Ranch and other tourist spots in the area. The gardens are spacious enough for the children to run around and enjoy the good weather of Tagaytay.
neg,When staying in Tagaytay  Taal Vista is the 1st choice primarily bec of its location and view. However  the hotel rooms and facilities are in need of repair/ renovation.
pos,Good
pos,everything is great fantastic vacation.
pos,It was good.
pos,We have been staying in this hotel at least twice a year since 2010. Some things worth returning to: stunning view of Taal volcano; cool weather; attentive hotel staff; good food! They just keep getting better each visit.
neg,Location and view are very overwhelming  very good to see the taal volcano. The staff are nice and helpful. The hotel is a bit expensive  we stay in the premier lake view but without the bath tub. Good thing we just stay for one night. I think other hotel nearby can also offer good service in a more competitive price.
neg,Everything is great except for the lack of bidet in comfort rooms...
pos,Good
pos,Booked a superior room  insider deals plus agoda reward points made the room affordable. Our room is located on the mountain wing which has no view of the taal lake but near the swimming pool. Although the room is a bit outdated  we slept comfortably. My kids enjoyed the bath tub in the bathroom. Breakfast buffet was nice  all the selection tastes good.
pos,Very pleasant. Staff were very courteous and attentive. The rooms at the New Wing were very good.
neg,It was one of the best tagaytay experience ever! So relaxing that I dont want to go back to work anymore. Lol but the massage service is extremely expensive. 6k pesos for 2pax  that's supposed to be another night stay already lol but t'was our choice  we were too lazy to go out of the hotel. That was the most expensive body massage we've ever had. Haha p.s you can have a body massage in tagaytay cheapest for 600 pesos for 2pax only.
neg,It is a great hotel for a weekend away from Manila. Everything was positive with only one complaint. The main attraction nearby is Taal volcano and the hotel no longer organises trips to visit the volcano. They also (probably for legal reasons) cannot offer advice about how to do it. So we walked across the street to the McDonalds and found a tout who set things up for us. As the volcano is the main attraction the hotel should either offer tours or provide advice about how to book a tour. To do neither is  in my opinion  a real problem.
neg,breakfast was not good  it was pricey
pos,A very relaxing weekend with a grand view of Taal Lake and Volcano together with hospitable and very friendly hotel staff worked very satisfactory with my wife and two children. We are already planning our next weekend at the hotel.
neg,As the hotel was badly damaged by the typhoon  I did not get to enjoy the stay due to many inconveniences.
neg,This is a very nice hotel and definately price-quality superb  although the breakfast is very shameful  not much variety and poorly prepared  the juices tast artificial  the bacon is so crunchy it just breaks in pieces and does not have tast pancakes and waffles are already prepared hours before and or now spongy so many staff wandering around   but still we have to call them to ask for coffee or tea  many flies in the breakfast area. But once again the rooms are their money more then worthed!! Just take your breakfast outside in as example 'Skyranch' just 100m down the road.
pos,It was great! Since I am with my family that time and the kids enjoyed the hotel. Much recommended!
pos,Good but too expensive to stay  but its a nice wxperience to enjoy the sights food and other attraction that sorround it esp the taal.
pos,I loved it. The only complaint is that the fitness center is a joke. Other than that it was an amazing stay. The room was comfortable. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The view was breath taking. The weather was cool and enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel.
pos,great and memorable
pos,ok
pos,I had a comfortable and restful stay. I'll definitely come back. It was a great idea to improve the hotel and be a landmark of tourism in Tagaytay.
pos,I enjoyed my stay at Taal Vista.
pos,Wonderful stay and very relaxing place to stay. Me and my wife had so much fun looking at the Taal Volcano. The food was great and the room is very clean. We will definitely be back next year. The hotel attendants were veru attentive to our requests.
pos,It was all good. Location is good - beside Sky Ranch  infront of Casinos and near Restaurants. Breakfast - has a good spread. View - amazing outside. Room - clean and comfortable. Wifi - fast and free. Highly recommended. Would definitely come back.
pos,comfortable room big enough.
pos,Our stay was perfect in everyway the staff made us feel at home and welcome the hotel is world class and situated in one of the worlds most breathtaking places the views and surroundings are those you will never forget.We only had a short stay but we will certainly return and spend more time there.I recommend the Taal Vista to anyone looking for a once in a lifetime experience you won't forget.Thank's to all the staff at Taal Vista.
pos,I'll just say  I can't wait to return back!!! The view from our room was amazing.
pos,It was good overall. Rooms was clean  enjoyed the pool and the view of taal lake. Would stay here again
pos,Apart from the fact that it is close to Taal Volcano  which is superb scenery...the weather was fine in here 'coz it is pretty hot in the Metro...a quiet getaway from the buzz of the city...
pos,I can say it was very good and would love to visit again
pos,Stayed there for a wedding nearby; we enjoyed our overnight stay.
pos,It was very relaxing  we were able to rest well. The service was superb  the hotel was quiet  the weather was great.
pos,Taal Vista is rather pricey  and you get the same nice amenities that is expected from a hotel in this price range. What makes Taal Vista special for me is the service that you get from EVERYONE -- the bell boy who helped me carry my stuff even before I entered the lobby  the front desk personnel  the receptionist at the breakfast restaurant  all the waiters. It's a pity that I failed to get even a single name. I will next time  because I'll surely be back  probably for the December holidays.
pos,We visited during Easter after spending a few days in Manila-left the madness and headed up there for some quiet time. Very busy around due to Easter period but room was nice and quiet the grounds nice and quiet-good stay!!
pos,nice hotel and friendly crew and nice food
pos,Great and relaxing night after a friends's wedding in Tagaytay
pos,Had no difficulty sleeping. It was relaxing & romantic.
pos,A great hotel to stay at with good dining and accomodations.
pos,the bed was comfortable and the views from our room was exceptionally beautiful
neg,Good  location  friendly staff  food not so good  there was only buffet breakfast available
pos,Very enjoyable and relaxing.
neg,Great for get away  but screen needs to be installed at the terrace.for good circulation of air.
pos,good relaxation and quiet environment.
pos,Fantastic. I will bring my kids back again.
neg,If you are staying at Taal Vista for a wedding or conference then it will probably suit you perfectly. However  we were there for the weekend to explore the local area and found the hotel to be extremely bland. The main problem however  was the same that many visitors have mentioned - I booked a Deluxe Lake Room and was given a room with no balcony and no view of the lake. The reception staff explained that most of the Deluxe rooms and all of the Superior rooms have no or only a partial view of the lake. You would expect all rooms in a hotel called Taal Vista to have a vista of Taal Lake! We were shown alternative rooms and were finally given one of only 5 ground floor rooms that have a view. If you are visiting this hotel because of the view - which is spectacular  particularly at sunrise and sunset - be very clear when booking that you want a room with a view.
pos,A great bonding time with the family  greatfood and friendly staff.
neg,As usual  we had a great stay in the hotel. The only thing about it that's bothersome is its lack of bidet in the toilet.
pos,We arrived at about 5pm. Very quick check in no hassles. But we preferred the new wing. The old wing has old carpet  old furnishings. The last time we were there we changed room coz the faucet was leaking. Dinner was good and the waiters were nice and polite. Buffet breakfast was great with assorted choices. But one has to come early because the main dining area is packed.The waiters were friendly to serve us drinks because we were seated far from the breakfast tables. Check out was fast.I love Taal Vista Hotel.
pos,Nice very lovely
pos,Fine.
pos,I wanna go back to this hotel because its moneys worth and very unwinding experience.
pos,Simply Superbbbb!!!
pos,Amazing and family friendly hotel. Gym is bad but u will spend most of ur time outdoors
pos,Very pleasant stay.
neg,it was nice and relaxing with a bit of inconveniences. pool and spa are located only on one side of of the complex. our room was on the other side so we have to walk a bit far before we can use the pool and go to the spa. should have a wider variety of food choices at the restaurant.
pos,The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Room is big and nicely arranged. You can actually spend a few days just within the hotel because of its great location and excellent amenities. Lobby area is very nice. Food is excellent as well. Centrally located and accessible to main attractions in the area.
pos,You should definitely try staying at Taal Vista if you want to have that luxurious feel of a hotel while not feeling overwhelmed. The proximity of the hotel to establishments also made it easier for us (Mushroom Burger  Bulalo Point  Sky Ranch  and more). The exclusive view from the gardens/terraces of the Hotel on the Taal Lake and Volcano made our stay really worthwhile. It would even slip on your mind to not leave the hotel because everything is already there.
pos,Had a great 1 night stay  we like how the room and bathroom are clean which made our stay a pleasant one.
pos,Our stay was great and very convenient to walk near Sky Ranch
neg,Rooms are clean  location is quiet  unfortunately wasn't able to get a lake view room. Wished the toilets had bedets. Overall I would recommend for couples and small families alike.
pos,Taal Vista Hotel is one of my favorite hotels in the Philippines. Great service  friendly staff  and great ambiance. However  the room I got this time around needed some fixtures especially in thw bathroom area but overall  I enjoyed my stay as expected. Keep it up! (And don't overlook the small things as I know Taal Vista has great attention to detail)
pos,It was nice. We will go back and stay at the same hotel anytime. Quiet  calming and relaxing experience.
pos,That was one of the most unforgettable weekend treat for my mother who is 74yrs old now. It is very accessible to the places she always wanted to go ro in Tagaytay. We will definitely go back here.
pos,in general it was good  i enjoy the nice view  nice surronding nice breakfast nice stuff.
pos,Best place to go when you just decided to stay away from the stress in Manila. Good food  nice view  clean rooms and polite employees.
pos,We arrived three hours early of check- in schedule but front desk personnel were very accommodating. Lobby staff were also friendly and helpful. Its quite hot outside but we enjoyed going around the hotel. Spacious room  clean bathroom and nice view from window. We would stay here again soon.
pos,excellent!
pos,I spent there my holy week with my family and we enjoyed the very nice view of Taal lake. They are very centrally located and just beside sky ranch where kids love to visit once again. They only was a bit disappointed since the pool is quite small but nevertheless the lifeguard was very warm  friendly and accommodating. He even extended extra hours so kids had a great time to bond with their cousins. Definitely would be coming back again.
pos,It was our first time to stay in Taal Vista with our 3-year old child. I would like to commend the staff for being so friendly and accomodating. The amenities were very good. My only comment was that the noise from the room beside us was very audible and we could clearly hear what the occupants there were talking about. Other than that  this hotel is still very good and I will book a room here again on our next Tagaytay visit.
pos,I had a wonderful stay with my friends. It was fun to just chill.Great and comfy room. A great plus for the awesome breakfast and the large area to walk around and stay. Also  other restaurants were not so far  though not quite walkable either. All in all  this is a great place to just chill and have fun.
neg,I hope the hotel would renovate their rooms. They're very clean but the designs are so outdated.
pos,still the best hotel in the area
pos,good price. great staff performance -- still remembers me from the last time i stayed and accomodated special requests. great view of taal from the cafe
pos,I would defeinitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. The breakfast was great. And the hotel was very clean. My son went to the kids activity room. We enjoyed our stay.. :)
pos,great and enjoyable.
pos,nice  relaxing!
pos,its good and nice... but GAAAD! the price are sooo much.. u pay 1500 pesos for their regular massage... :( but the stay was nice for two days
pos,It was a very relaxing stay. Fast check in & check out. Very accommodating & friendly staff. I just wish the pool was warm. It was cold because of the weather.
neg,Our stay in Taal Vista was ok  but not good enough for the money we paid. It is centrally located in Tagaytay and has ample parking. Points of criticism: - Room was not cleaned or maintained properly. Shower door would not open fully  and was filthy underneath. Shower aircon and toilet very noisy. - Wifi is very spotty  though free - The parking management is very inconvenient - guests have to get their entry ticket stamped each time (instead of just presenting the room key  for example). - Bar closes early - 11pm on weekends! Overall  I would not recommend spending a lot of money on rooms in this hotel. Next time  we shall look one with better value-for-money.
pos,it was fun and exciting
pos,VERY GOOD
pos,I FEEL RELAXED
pos,Suberb and got a chance to bond with family on a nice weather.
pos,I've been to the Taal Vista Hotel as a kid but never stayed there. It has always been a landmark and this time the opportunity presented itself so we stayed there for 2 nights. Though we did not spend much time at the hotel you can tell that it has been completely overhauled and renovated to get it's charm back from yesteryear. What we enjoyed most apart from the clean rooms of course  was sitting on the terrace and having breakfast. Most Filipinos shy away from the sun and sit indoors in aircon but we made most of the view and enjoyed our breakfast buffet out on the terrace overlooking the Taal Volcano - bliss!
pos,there is a great view to see taal volcano from our room although it is on the 1st floor  we enjoyed in their garden and pool. the double room is clean and wide  the internet connection is outstanding
pos,Relaxing- tried their spa and it was a great experience Good location- offers good view of the taal volcano  near the new amusement park (sky ranch)and restaurants (krispy kreme  leslie's  mushroom burger  Mcdo just right across  etc) Spacious room with floor to ceiling window Comfortable large bed good for family with small kid Attentive staff Deluxe room is far from the pool area
neg,It's a top hotel  but like all top hotels in Tagatay  it's expensive. It's palacial - huge. With long corridors and a clinical design  it's reminiscent of a big hospital or government building in the room wings. Paying extra for a Lake Wing room  I was expecting a view of the lake/volcano  but the room faced the main road and I had to be extra again  for a lake view. Otherwise  everything was fine.
neg,My sister and I on separate incident was locked in the elevator for good 2 to 3 minutes according to the staff when they reviewed cctv. The person who answered the emergency call that I made from the elevator has NO idea that there are people that has claustrophobia who can go crazy when confined in a very tight space such as the hotel elevator and when they finally let me out  the two men was just looking at me and the only thing that they asked me was my room number. I was freaking out. I had to take valium to ride the plane. They should send the front desk and the emergency responders to a customer service class to learn how to talk to people
neg,I paid a lot of money for a room with a view of the lake and volcano. When i checked in i found out i didnt have this and had to pay EXTRA to upgrade. I did this as the whole reason for choosing this hotel was for the view...!!!
neg,The room was comfortable  clean  but not luxurious. Internet access was spotty. Staff was a mixture of very attentive to somewhat attentive (in restaurant). If you stay here  pay the extra charge to have a room facing Taal lake  hotel has a spectacular vantage point for lake and volcano views. Hotel offers an excellent array of spa  food  transportation  and related services. Weakest aspect of hotel is the restaurant. Staff are not attentive  and the food is mediocre. While they offer an international menu  the cooks are clearly not familiar with how to prepare dishes like the schnitzel which was deep fried and to dry in was difficult to cut.
neg,The Hotel is old & needs renovation. The staff is unhelpful. Like the location and proximity to attractions.
neg,Not very good. Reception was careless - did not even give an orientation on rooms and other amenities. Room was not ready  amenities were missing.
neg,Not good  very poor service and sanitary. Checking out took a long time. A mouse was roaming inside our room
neg,The breakfast is good  however the service is bad  we got locked out in our room  our key card was not working and took time for them to attend to us because there was no service phone available in our area.. Luckily I have saved the reception number on my cellphone. As we were waiting to check out and waiting for the room service there was a mouse that ran inside our room.. I did not expect the kind of service taal vista is giving knowing it is owned already by a big company and the price that we paid for.
pos,actually it was my mom and sister who went there  i booked it for them as a gift because i'm always there. basically it's really a nice hotel for me to do such. thank you taal vista hotel for catering my family well.
pos,I booked 4 superior mountain view rioms to be used as wedding prep rooms. During our checked in  when the hotel learned that it will be used as the wedding prep room  they upgraded 2 of our rooms to Superior Lake View for 2 night for free! Yey!
pos,nice service good quality rooms perfect view. good value for money
neg,I have no reason to come back  I had high hopes that this will be one of those stress free hotels  but I was wrong. It's a 4 star hotel located in the middle of everything you would intend to do along Tagaytay. It's right beside Sky Ranch  just across the Casino  a walking distance from the supermarket  and just a jeepney ride for other restaurant choices. Somehow  the good news for us ended there. Our room was basic  bed was decent  but it's something I could've gotten somewhere else at a lower rate  probably at a boutique type hotel where the service would have been a lot warmer. In Taal Vista  we were like ghosts  from the drive through the gates  to the check-in  down to the event the following day as well at parking. Saving grace of the hotel was the breakfast buffet  they had loads of bacon.
neg,nothing at all but maybe changes the pillow to a softer one.
pos,It was very nice and relaxing. The staff are very friendly and attentive. The rooms are large and clean as well as the restrooms. The food  specially in buffet.
pos,Perfect place to relax & unwind  friendly & attentive staff  big & clean rooms.
neg,We arrived at the hotel for check-in at almost 4pm  and I expected that I should not be waiting for a room anymore  given that check-in time is 2pm. Of course this was not the case  and when I complained about this to the manager  she even raised an eyebrow at me and did not even apologize. She did mutter a cold I will check on this  but that was about it  without any follow-throughs. You could definitely find a much better accommodation for the price of this hotel.
pos,We had a pleasant stay. Buffet breakfast had some variety. Although taste was average  we appreciate that there was bacon and an eggs/omelet station. Fast and hassle-free check-in and check-out. Rooms are situated a bit far from the main lobby  dining area and parking lot - not so convenient when you have to walk under the scorching sun mid-afternoon.
pos,The stay was comfortable  but be prepared to walk a lot! Our room took roughly 10 minutes to walk to due to the size of the hotel. But the suite that we had was perfect to see Taal Volcano. Of the majority of hotels in Tagaytay  this is probably the nicest.
pos,Our stay was absolutely fun and relax. With the view of taal volcano  the cool weather and the proximity of the restaurants are the perfect ingredients for a weekend getaway. .
pos,You could locate Taal Vista easily with its architecture. Once you get to see their viewing deck  you will be mesmerized by the view of Taal. Parking is not a problem. There are so many rooms in the new building. Good enough size of the bedroom. Filipino breakfast is also deliciuous.
pos,I will definitely go back to Taal Vista  I love the Buffet!
pos,Good. It was a great venue to relax  unwind and bond with the whole family.
pos,Taal Vista Hotel is a landmark in Tagaytay. Beautiful structure. The hotel blends in with the surroundings. It is not imposing and will give the feel that you are in the country away from the smoke and bustle of the city. It has maintained its relaxing feel despite the many developments in the area
neg,I was not happy with the room that I got. the Agoda picture of the Deluxe room and the actual room is not the same. the beds in the picture is a 1 queen and 1 single configuration  what I got was 2 single beds. Talk to the front desk but was told that it was Agoda's mistake and not them. the lake wing does not mean you will see the lake  what I got was the noisy side facing the highway.
pos,Great location. Good for family with young kinds. Accesible. Location along the highway. Food is decent.
neg,We stayed at the lake wing. Bathroom didnt have a door  when you walk into the room  you can see the faucet on the right. Shower head wasn'tt nice - made it hard to shower. toilet and shower area had a slightly foul odor. Room and linens were ok. Extra pillow had stains.
pos,Well managed  with very nice location in Tagaytay  but some rooms are very old. Though very well managed  you can see the difference compared with new hotels.
pos,Large Room  Great Staff  Fast Internet  breakfast buffet spread was too little and taste are just normal  nevertheless  it was it was a great and superb hotel! 4 thumbs up
pos,It was a sweet short vacation for my family. We really enjoyed the cold weather of Tagaytay. The location of the hotel is ideal. Thumbs up to the Pastry Chef who baked the Banana Chocolate Caramel cake which we ordered at the lobby lounge. It was so delicious! Soft  moist  not too sweet! :) The sugar free Cheesecake and Food for the Gods were also ok. My brother loved the blueberry cheesecake. The breakfast buffet was ok. Like the ensaymada bread. Also  we would like to commend Ms. Sarah and Mr. Raffy Viscal of Front Office for the fast check in and out of the hotel.
neg,2 out of the 4 rooms we used had malfunctioning tv sets. If anything can ruin a vacation  it's having a couple of guys in the room with us trying to fix the tv. In fairness  they were very nice and were able to fix the trouble. The mini ref was not working at all. This was really irritating because it was Christmas Eve and we brought so much food and drinks for the noche buena.On Christmas Day  we were expecting to have a quiet lunch at the hotel's main restaurant  which we knew had a very reasonably priced menu because we had just stayed at that hotel last February. To our dismay  they did not want to serve us anything from the menu  which they claimed would take a very long time because the kitchen was very busy with the special Christmas buffet lunch. In short  we had no choice but to eat from the buffet which cost a whopping P1 600 per person. Our only other choice would have been to get out of the hotel and scout around for another restaurant  but everyone was so famished so we just decided to stay. The saving grace of this hotel is its very gracious and courteous housekeeping and front desk staff. The plus factors are the huge bathrooms and the coffeemakers with free coffee and water. Minus factors are the small beds which are only good for 2 people. At the 2 other hotels we stayed during 2 other Christmases  both had 2 huge beds per room  large enough for 4 people. Most guests travel by families and this means it is very rare that there are only 2 people staying in one room. They better not expect their guests to get a separate room just for their children as first  it is not safe and not good practice to leave minors in another room; and second  for the price they are charging  a family should be able to fit comfortably in one room.
pos,Very good  relaxing  nice  good  nice food! Sure that we will be coming back!
pos,Our stay was almost perfect if it did not end. On a serious note  we were upgraded to the Premiere Lake room where we could see the majestic Taal Volcano. Breathtaking view! Good thing no wedding reception or conference happened during our stay so it is peaceful and relaxing. The room was huge and the design was beautiful. Toiletries were of generous amount. Room service was fast and very attentive to our needs knowing it was during peak period  just after New Year's. Breakfast with the Taal view is one for the books. I must say  we are extremely satisfied of our stay here. We will definitely be back. :)
neg,The view is great  the breakfast is limited  and the air is polluted. We were surprised to see our white car all covered with thick brown colored soil or dust in just 2 nights. This maybe due to a lot of development going around the area. It was a great location  sky ranch is just beside it  restaurants are just very near  but I prefer to wait until all constructions are done before going there again.
pos,Their staff were friendly and really give their full service to their guests. The food is okay  but very limited choices. I like the hot chocolate every morning and their bulalo.
pos,We usually stay on this hotel during summer. But this time it is our first to stay here to celebrate the New Year. We arrived Dec 30 and departed Jan 1  2014. Our stay was awesome. The fireworks display was beautiful. The dinner buffet with the band singing to celebrate the new year wasl perfect . One of my best stays. I will go back again to celebrate NY pf 2015.
pos,nice hotel  friendly staffs also... we enjoyed our stay.. we spent our new years eve there & the weather was nice & pretty cold pefect for our much awaited vacation..
pos,There are beautiful views  clean rooms  and excellent staff. Breakfast and lunch are a good value. Good priced airport transfer. Very good spa treatments  reasonably priced as well.
pos,Good. Comfortable. Nice ambiance. However  if you are looking for a nice and quiet place  it's a mistake to come during the holidays esp Christmas time as the whole complex is really crowded. I think the management should not allow non-staying guests to loiter around the viewing area or veranda....at least during HOLIDAY SEASON as some people get rowdy and noisy to the inconvenience of house guests. Tried both lunch and dinner buffet. Food was good and the spread was varied and aplenty. I understand they upgraded the menu in time for the holidays. We enjoyed some happy hour at the bar with nice entertainment. Service is commendable. Overall  had a wonderful stay. Thank you taal vista hotel.
pos,my children loved the room and the location's just near the pool.staff were friendly and very helpful. the ambience was awesome with beautiful christmas decors and tall christmas trees. we had fun celebrating new years eve watching those fantastic and awesome fireworks! skyranch just beside the hotel. mcdonalds just across the street though they don't serve their usual breakfast menu. the hotel has kultura store where we bought our pasalubongs. we will surely come back to spend our christmas vacation.
pos,Though it was a brief stay  I was so happy to have spent a precious bonding moment with my family at such a comfortable place like this far from pollution  smoke  noise  etc.
pos,will definitely return and spend christmas eve again in this hotel because the staff are friendly and accomodating!
neg,Our stay at the Taal Vista Lodge was adequate. However  had I known that they had special discounts for SM Advantage card holder  I would have gotten better value. The room we stayed at was adequate but it was a bit old. Tagaytay is a cool place so swimming may not be recommended. It would have been good if they had a sauna but they didn't. The best thing about it? The fast internet service.
pos,We spent our Christmas at TAAL VISTA HOTEL  was really one of the BEST CHRISTMAS experience ever...The staff were all friendly and attentive...They even accompanied us to our room for our baggage...Location is perfect for the family...Just along the highway near to major attractions and well known restaurants...We all enjoyed our stay here and plan to go back again in the future.
pos,The staffs are well-trained and very courteous. Staffs are friendly and they respond quickly to your needs. Room size is adequate. Beds are comfortable. Needless to say that Taal Vista has one of the best views of Taal Volcano. We are quite satisfied with our stay at the hotel and will definitely stay at this hotel again in the future. To the great friendly staffs of Taal Vista- keep it up!:)
neg,We had a horrible experienced from this hotel  room description were misleading  and very small rooms  this will be the last time we will stay and spent our Christmas holidays in this hotel.
neg,Taal Vista was an okay hotel. It's not a luxury hotel  but it is not bad either. It has a good view of the Taal volcano  and a sprawling lawn where the kids can run around and have fun. However  i dont like their bathrooms (lakeside). the toilet is separate from the shower  which separation i dont really mind  except that the doors to each are not really closed completely. neither is there a door separating the shower/toilet area from the rest of the room. So  when housekeeping comes in and your child or spouse is taking a poop in the toilet  housekeeping will smell everything. Neither is there a kettle in the room  though there are instant coffee and tea available. You have to request for hot water and they will provide you hot water in a pot. Would i come back? Maybe yes for the view and my children can run in the garden during nice weather  but i would not come back for hotel comfort and relaxation. I can stay in other hotels with better comforts for the same price.
pos,Satisfied with the hotel service. Great swimming pool and the free internet was a bonus.
neg,Hotel was very busy  crowded and noisy. Restaurant service and housekeeping were atrocious. Overall it was adequate for our purpose of stay at Taal Vista.
pos,Our stay was great in general. The hotel provides an awesome view of the Taal Volcano. It has its own viewing deck and a big garden where people can just sit and relax while admiring the view as well as the chill weather. The room was okay  not as big as what we expected but four people could fit in a superior room. The bathroom was huge. The swimming pool was big and they turn on the heater. Breakfast buffet was good also  they offered a variety. Some tourist destinations are accessible and walking distance such as Sky Ranch  Mushroom burger and the Casino. There is also a Mcdonalds right in front of the hotel.
neg,It was alright. The travel from Manila to Taal Vista took longer than expected due to heavy traffic. The new adventure recently constructed which is adjacent to the hotel made it worst to get through. The long drive is what discouraged us to go back to this place.
pos,We stayed in Taal Vista Hotel and I couldn't be more satisfied. The Hotel has been renovated and upgraded in every way. Aside from the great location  the rooms are big and comfortable. Taal Vista Hotel can now be considered a 5 star hotel in Tagaytay.
neg,We spent 4 nights over the 2013 Christmas period. Booked through Agoda so no Christmas package deals. At check-in we made reservations for the Christmas Eve dinner buffet  however when we arrived at the restaurant  there was no reservation and we were given a table at the extreme end of the patio area. Food was OK  typical buffet food  turkey undercooked - blood dripping. Room clean and comfortable with connecting door to children's room. Games room was a joke. room too small for snooker table  cue kept hitting the walls. One set of darts with only two flites. No refreshment facilities in games room. Gardens and surrounding well maintained as is the hotel itself. Expensive but it was the Christmas vacation period.
pos,Room was just normal clean room. it means not that fancy. but Hotel has very good view  cannot compared with another hotels. Good for lovers  family and business trip all. Try this.
neg,We stayed here in the midst of a typhoon so the view wasn't that nice and it was just foggy. Room is huge and breakfast is OK. Toilet's isn't that private  I would've liked it more if the toilet is more private.
pos,The stay was alright. It was relaxing. The breakfast was great. Its near the sky ranch. My children just walked from the hotel to sky ranch  no need to worry about the parking. The only thing that disappoints me is that our room has no view of the taal lake. I booked for a lake view but the room given is not a lake view.I did not complained  we just walked through the gardens and balcony which provides a good view of the Taal lake.
pos,No Frills and staff were very accommodating. We were able to check in and out in less than five minutes. One of the best features of the hotel is the great number of parking spaces available. I also like the security of the entire place  makes 1 feel safe.
pos,My stay at taal vista was really one of the greatest out of town experience ever. I was with my husband who was disabled at that moment. The staff were all friendly and attentive to our needs. they even accompanied us to our room everytime we go in and out of the hotel. breakfast buffet was delicious and satisfying. Location is good as well. just along the highway near major attractions and well known reataurants .over all we enjoyed our stay here.
pos,My boyfriend and I celebrated our anniversary in Taal Vista. It was very romantic - from the wonderful lake view  to the hug-conducive atmosphere in Tagaytay  the romantic lobby show and the sumptuous buffet breakfast. There was even a wedding concurrent to our stay in the hotel. The service was also five-star  considering that  a few years ago it was an issue in the hotel. There are many reviews available in the internet for this hotel  and I couldn't agree more to the positive reviews that this hotel has.
pos,We loved our stay. The staff especially Regie and nurse (Ann?) went above and beyond any expectation I had.
pos,PERFECT WE WILL RETURN SOMEDAY.THE VIEW OF THE LAKE AND VOLCANO IS BREATHTAKING.
neg,"Restaurant expensive and very mediocre service bad and very slow. ATM subject to power cuts and suddenly my card is there ,,,, Arrived at noon my room was not ready and I had to pay an upgrade of php 1000 to have a room ..... .bizarre no"
pos,It was relaxing and re-energizing. I tried their spa services and it was worth the price. What was significant for this hotel stay  was the courtesy and honesty of the staff who returned something I left from their hotel.
pos,My stay in this hotel is unforgettable because is the beautiful view  excellent food and excellent service of the staff..
pos,Taal Vista will always be a destination when you think about Tagaytay. It affords the best view of Taal volcano and the lake  pictures will be most memorable. Food might be steeper than the other areas but it is quite an adventure. I have been coming here for conferences but this time around  coming with my husband proved romantic especially with our suite at the Lake View wing. It just takes your breath away-- that fabulous view and especially if you can experience seeing it at different times of the day... My favorite was of course at the dawn of the new day. My husband and i waited for daylight to break and it was awesome. If we had more time  another day would have been great!-- D and S Brown Nov 2013
pos,It was great. Its my 3rd time and will still book at this hotel whenever i plan to go tagaytay again. This hotel is superb. Stayed for 3 days 2 nights and tried the mountain view  view was not so nice but the room is comfortable.
pos,The weather and traffic was cooperative at the time we stayed which apparently is something to be thankful for because traffic can be horrendous there. The hotel was spread out and it took more than the usual walk to get to our room. In exchange I suppose most rooms got a great view. The room was spacious and the amenities were great  there was even a tub. No ironing board though and no bathrobes. Its a walk away from 24hr diners including a mushroom specialty place  theres a casino across and a park with rides beside. A short ride away are everything else  more restaurants  park and a church. Great place for a conference if you want to keep the delegates confined but not feeling it.
pos,The hotel property is excellent and well maintained. Very nice pool and public areas. Great view of Taal Volcano.
neg,The Hotel is nice though very overated. Whilst the rooms were nice and clean  the surroundings are well maintained..the restaurent food was a sheer dissappointment.
neg,Satisfactory. The only complain is the there were no doors for the shower and comfort rooms.
neg,We stays here but didn't eat here  and actually only spent time in the room. The quality of the place was impressive  the room was quite nice and the view  as you may have gathered  was sensational  my only complaint was that to get such a view  I thought paying extra for the Lake Wing would do it. Alas  no. We were informed at check in that a view would be an extra 1000 pesos. Since the girl who checked us in had a prepared apology for the confusion  apparently this happens all the time. So be warned
pos,my stay was Great. Free fast wifi  nice view  clean surrounding. Though the elevators are far from the lobby.
pos,It's good time to stay at Taal Vista Hotel  it is worth as 5 star hotel.
pos,A relaxing and convenient getaway from Metro Manila. In contrast to the hotel staff - who were very professional and attentive - travelers need to be aware of the aggressive and manipulative hawkers trying to sell rides down to the lake and boat rides onward to the volcano. This sours the experience. So come prepared with an idea of how you will get down to the lake and what boat service you will use.
neg,My stay in Taal Vista is okay. Very clean surroundings  friendly staff. What I do not like is their wifi services. Poor signal.
neg,The staff are friendly specially the bellboy but the lady who accepts the stub for breakfast somewhat like a snob or belittling hotel guests..hope to let her undergo customer service training. All in all nice stay with the hotel.
neg,On the whole  it was a relaxing stay. My only complaints are 1) the bathroom sink was not cleaned very properly  2) the bath mat did not look clean being permanently stuck to the tub  and 3) the housekeeping staff did not seem to be knowledgeable about operating the new high definition TV.
pos,The hotel was clean and big  the hotel was very accomodating. I feel relaxed when i stayed in this hotel  actually it's my 2nd time here and will continue to book at this hotel whenever i will go in tagaytay for overnight stay. The view in the room was good  and they have a large place for sight seeing.
pos,as I always in tagaytay  I know taal vista hotel as its located in the heart of tagaytay. its near to fine restaurant and parks. the room is clean but hard to access the television. wi-fi is so poor and hard to access. good breakfast and staff is so accommodating.
pos,I enjoyed my stay at Taal Vista Hotel. They have friendly staff and clean room. I will definitely recommend Taal Vista to my friends.
pos,We are relaxed after the tiring week. The weather is cool and the place is very comfortable.
pos,Our stay here was fantastic..near sky ranch new theme park in the area  climate was so cold and surroundings were so clean..complete ameneties..
pos,VERY ENJOY AND RELAXING WHILE STAYING IN TAAL VISTA HOTEL W/ MY FAMILY.I REALLY APPRECIATE THE TAAL VOLCANO VIEW AND I LIKE THE GARDEN SO NICE.THE STAFF IS VERY FRIENDLY AND ATTENTIVE.GREAT JOB TO ALL STAFF AT TAAL VISTA HOTEL.
pos,Our stay was relaxing with nice view and music with food at lobby. We did not get to see the golf courses around because of the rain. I noticed that there is horse ranch nearby. A ferry's wheel overlooking Taal lake volcano is nearby. I think there are many activities around the area. We will be back next time and spend more days.
pos,Staff is very attentive since I requested for a 2 beds but at the time of check in there is no available room with 2 beds he offered us an extra bed without any charge.
neg,Not that pleasant: (1) Long check-in process (took 20-30min) (2) Shower drainages (for the 2 rooms we got) are clogged (3) Old facilities (i.e. game room  gym) (4) Pool is too far from other rooms (need to walk in cold air going back); Pool is too small for the whole hotel. (5) Not too much choices for the breakfast food (some doesn't taste good) (6) LOW...value for what you paid for.
pos,it was comfortable and relaxing. it was an excellent weekend get away for our family
pos,It is good! If ever I will come back to Tagaytay it will be Taal Vista Hotel again..
pos,Hotel is nice  I was there for a friends wedding held on hotel lawn overlooking the lake. It was very scenic  very nice setting for a wedding. My room was average for the price and did not have a mountain view  dispite the name  as it faced a parking area. Location is quite a distance from Manila and is out on edge of town.
pos,Enjoyed our stay in this hotel. View from the hotel was relaxing & the hotel provided all that we needed. I suggest 'though to have an enclosed access from the rooms to the lobby for easy movement during rainy days. 'Appreciated much the Sunday holy mass for the guests.
pos,Very nice location you can see the task volcano lake in your room balcony
neg,It could have been better if the weather is fair. We were not able to fully enjoy the scenery because of the typhoon. Best to go in this location during the summer.
pos,My family enjoyed the sight seeing. It's worth our family bonding.
pos,The hotel exceeded our expectations. Everything that we need for our short vacation is right in the hotel: scenic view of taal  relaxed mood  fun activities  swimming pool  and friendly and attentive staff. Although the cost is a little bit pricey  the overall hotel experience is a great value for money. We will definitely come back
neg,not worth the money  incredibly un-attentive staff  every little thing that could go wrong did (noise  lengthy waits  cold food  broken fixtures  poor service  overpriced services  confusing and unmapped floor plan  etc). The staff: talagang wala silang paki-alam sa customers.
pos,We stayed for our anniversary. It was very good and will use the same hotel for our wedding
pos,It was comfortable and relaxing. My family enjoyed the food served at breakfast buffet. We all liked the souvenir at the hallway: kultura all Filipino items. The entertainment is good at the lobby especially the musicians.
pos,Relaxing weekend stay away from the city but close enough to take the road trip that takes around an hour from Makati City.
pos,My wife and I were enjoying our 42nd wedding anniversary and the on duty manager Jermaine  went out of his way to ensure we had a fantastic stay. His attention to detail in helping us find the best room with a gorgeous view was note worthy. Will return soon!!
neg,Wifi helps a lot. The parking lot though is too far from the rooms. The windows was left unlocked  an easy access for robbers to get in..
pos,Great experience!! splendid .excellent  will definitely come back in the future  will bring family and friends.
pos,Very good stay  the staff where very friendly and assisting customers well. security was in place.
pos,it was an excellent quick stay  which is closed to nightlife and the taal view is superb  highly recommended to tourist who are first timer in tagaytay.
pos,Relaxing and attentive staff. When I arrived at the room
pos,Ok very nice  its fun to stay there because you can roam around to enjoy the facilities. Especially the view of taal volcano where you can taje pictures.
pos,My stay at Taal Vista Hotel was very pleasant and at par with my expectation. It is my hotel of choice  being perfectly located at the center of what Tagaytay is known for- the view of the Taal lake. It is convenient and ideal for guests of all ages.
pos,Super attentive staff made my one night stay a pleasure. The view was fantastic to look at as was the surrounding hotel and its facilities.
pos,Very good quiet and nice to relax and good location
pos,We enjoyed our stay in the hotel. Good service and good entertainment.
pos,It was fun. I would recommend it to my relatives and friends. Planning to stay there again in the next few months.
pos,We booked the hotel for our wedding preps. It was far from the church but we still did book the hotel because of the room size and views of the Taal Volcano which was perfect for pictorial.
pos,The staff was very attentive. The rooms were large but I had myself upgraded to the Lake View Room and it was all worth it. Imagine waking up to the view of the Taal Volcano. Fantastic!
pos,After staying in various hotels in the Tagaytay area  I have decided that Taal Vista will be my home in Tagaytay. The rooms are large and well appointed. The lobby lounge is a great place to while away the afternoon with a fantastic view of the Taal Volcano.
pos,Overall the experience was very relaxing. We wanted to get-away from the stoic and crazy city life and staying at the hotel seemed to be a good choice. There is a nice view of the mountain from our window. The room was very comfortable. The weather was cool and perfect especially for couples. We tried the fried halo-halo just for kicks. It was good and unique. There is a variety of food choices in the restaurants. It is located just in front of Casino and a few minutes walk to Sky Ranch. One downside is the bathroom door. It is a tad bit difficult to slide open/close. Also the building is stretched horizontally - lakeside wing (left)  lobby (center) and mountain wing (right). We were situated at right most room of the mountain wing so getting to the lobby was quite a walk. There were only a few channels and not a lot of choices on the room service menu. But all of it was tolerable and were not really serious issues for us.
pos,relaxing  quiet  rejuvenating  nature  easy to go to and near restaurants and sights to visit but the most important thing was the privacy to our room but very far from the reataurant
neg,its quite disappointing at first because we want the mountain view room but ended up the name mountain wing is just the name of the building so i guess its quite expensive hotel with view of a rooftop. but it has a clean large bathroom and clean room and it was a pleasant stay in this hotel. unfortunately it is far from restaurants and the only transportion is jeepney  so we had to walk quite far to have dinner.
pos,ive been to taal many times but havent stayed. i would recommend taal to my friends and families  we had a wonderful and pleasant stay. i will surely comeback.
pos,Comfortable stay. Beautiful views off balconies to the Taal volcano and lake. We were upgraded to the second best suite at a discount price and enjoyed staying in a large 2 room suite with shared living area with our family. The walk to this suite is right around the hotel  but there is a shortcut from the external back side of the hotel. Kids play area is out of the way down stairs  making carrying a stroller down them uncomfortable. Toys in the playroom were broken and need upgrading. Besides this the room was top quality  food was standard  staff was friendly and hotel was attractive. There is a great souvenier shop too. The location is perfect for sightseeing.
pos,Had a great overnight stay! Check-in and check-out both hassle free. Comfortable bed  room big enough.
pos,Stayed here with my family  my fiance and my fiance's family. Amenities were okay. Parking could be confusing (mountain wing parking is quite of a walk to the other wing)  but staff are always around to help. Safe choice for a stay in Tagaytay for families. Rather boring for couples.
pos,Great! Very Quiet  Nice View of the Taal Volcano  I love the Murals
pos,We stayed for few days for my wedding in Tagaytay in July this year. Overall it was good and worth the money we paid. Luckily we booked via Agoda as booking directly to the hotel is a lot more expensive after personally checking. Booked a deluxe room with a lake view but there's actually no view in the room though the room was big and really nice. I should have asked the room to be changed but then I was too tired to do it. With a king bed and sofa bed altogether. There was a safe which didnt work at first but their staff were fast enough to settle this immediately. One wish for the hotel is for them to also provide breakfast in all rates offered by partners. This should be automatic. Also please note the wing if you book few rooms  lake wing and mountain wing is soooo at the opposite direction so walking to each room takes a lot of time and effort! The cart is only offered once you check in and you wont be able to use it after that. There's a BDO ATM machine beside the local shop on your way to the Lake Wing which is really convenient. Other than the breakfast not included in the room rates.... and quite a distance to walk to the other wing... its all good.
neg,what i did not like is i found out that i can get much cheaper rates (like 25% discounts) had i contacted the hotel itself and not through Agoda.
neg,nice hotel good food except for 1 terrrible meal... (dont order  from room service menu  the mexican chil carne... yuck !!! ) buffets were beautifully presnted and the food was good... great frozen margaritas  but a bit pricey... found all staff members very friendly and attentive... the trio of musicans was excellent.. sit in the dinning room at luch or early evening to hear them play... request spanish instrumental music.. great stuff.. nice hotel for couples... the one big complaint i had was the nightime entertainment... the entertainers/musicans are good enough  but each one cranked the amplifer so high  that it was difficult to have a soft conversation with the person next to you. It was so loud that it deterred my girlfriend and I from sitting there in the evening and enjoying drinks and desserts.... it was a big negative as that area is very beautifully decorated and comands a terrific view..but the music was completely over-powering...not the soft background sounds it should have been..... it is also a bit far to walk to local restaurants.. though a 30-50 pesos ride or 8 pesos jeepnie will get you there quick enough.Both not recommended if you are a very large or heavy person as both are tight squeezes to get into!
pos,I was really hoping for a very relaxing stay in Tagaytay City and Taal Vista really delivered. The staff are very friendly  the facilities are well-maintained  and all my requests were granted (in terms of room specifications and accommodations). Me and my girlfriend were treated like royalty  as well as everyone else (guests). I guess this raises the bar for hotels in the Philippines - probably one of the nicest  warmest places to have a fun  romantic weekend stay at. The hotel also had a great view of the Taal Volcano - probably the nearest and most breathtaking view of the volcano. Very couple-friendly and the service are consistently superb. Staff are all-smiles and are very warm to speak to. They even would engage you in genuine conversations which I found very homey and reflects the Filipino hospitality. I'd say this is one of the top three best countryside hotels in the Philippines. I hope they keep up the good work as I will definitely be coming back soon. Just positive things to say about this hotel. Two thumbs up!
pos,I initially booked a Mountain Wing Room but thereafter upgraded to Lakeview Room upon arrival. The Lakeview Room that we stayed have a clear and unobstructed view of Taal Lake and Taal Volcano. The staff were friendly also and the location is good. My only little complaint is that the Parking Lot might be packed during weekends. But overall I and my family were happy with the stay.
pos,it was very relaxing and such a great saving. we will definitely be coming back.
neg,It was great in everything but dinner menu was a bit poor
pos,good comfortable bed and pillow nice view of taal lake and volcano.
neg,Only thing I want them to improve on is customer service. Drank at the bar and there was an attendant that didn't know what she was doing. It took them 5-10 minutes for a bartender to take our orders. Other than that the stay was pleasant.
pos,Amazing place and the scenery is really good if you're a nature lover
neg,it was okay  had just expected so much. its a better place few year back than today.
pos,One of the best vacation we had. My family enjoyed the taal lake view w our premier room balcony and hot coffee  really love the place. will come back again for sure. food is good. Hotel is very clean  good smell of greenery and large and comfortable bed. Widw parking space and good restaurants. Try to order Bulalo for lunch or dinner  the best!
pos,The hotel was good! My son likes it so much. The only problem we encountered is that inside the room there are plenty tiny ants all over the mini bar and the tables. I don't know where it came from.Over all  I would rate it good! Oh the dinner buffet is not worth for the price! I think the breakfast is more worth it to try.
pos,Clean Room Nice pool (Wish it was open pasted 6pm) Good entertainment Great staff Wonderful views Really not much more to say.
pos,Thoroughly enjoyed my stay I would recommend the hotel to anyone
neg,Our stay was good and comfortable. The room price was not value for money as we only partial view of the Lake. The cheap wooden parquet flooring makes the rooms look cheap. We personally think the rates are over priced.
pos,Nice view  comfortable rooms. The bathroom need an upgrade like the toilet it does not have bidet.
neg,The location is nice but they lack in service. There is no concierge in the new wing so we have to make the trip all the way to the other bldg to make arrangements or simply validating the parking ticket everytime we go out. Even our bags  the security guard was the one who helped bring our bags to our rooms simply because ther bellboys are in the other bldg. For the room  bed was uncomfortable  comforters were worn out  pillows were not as soft as expected-i hardly had a good nights sleep. For the bathroom  there was no water bidet considering the toilet is separate from the shower. And theres no bathtub as well. The only good thing about it is the location and the cold weather  the rest was a bit disappointing.
pos,Will surely come back. Really love the place. My family enjoyed the Scnery view of the Taal lake and my grandchild enjoyed watching the clouds passing our room veranda. Premier room is much better because of the lake and garden view. Great to watch it with hot coffee. Very satisfied!
neg,I really liked our stay in Taal Vista. The room was comfortable and clean  there was enough parking  and the view was great! My biggest concern was that the staff sometimes were not so attentive. Parking also had to be validated by going to the other building of the hotel which was tedious.
neg,The room was in the basement with no elevator. The msttress was hard  towels were old and worn out. The bathroom was old and dirty. The description of the rooms in the internet was misleading. We chose Superior room but it was their standard room. The basement where our room was located was not handicap accessible with no elevator. The room was facing the grass area that was not mowed or cleared.
pos,It was awesome. I would also recommend this to my family and friends
pos,Great stay....very quite and relaxing atmosphere. I would recommend the hotel install doors to the entrance to the bathroom area in the deluxe lake view rooms for additional privacy.
pos,This was our first time to stay in Taal Vista and I've always heard good reviews for this hotel from my friends and so I thought that it was finally the time to try them out... and we didn't regret it. :) Word of the wise though: even if you book a room in the Lake Wing building  there's still a chance that you won't be given a room that has the view of Taal. We had to pay P2 000 more to get a room that has the view of Taal Lake/Volcano. Which we didn't mind.Now  the view over our room was really great! And given the atmosphere and ambiance of Tagayatay  Taal Vista really picked a sweet spot. Breakfast buffet was just okay; but the experience of having a morning meal in a cool environment  with a mystical feel around you (well  hello fog!) was very nice. Service was superb too and room service was quick. And unfortunately  we didn't get to try the swimming pool but it was just average. Not too big  and a life guard is always nearby. This is really close to the newly-opened Sky Park  so if you're up for some fun in a high ferris wheel  then go for it! We didn't do it though. Anyhow  our stay was great overall. A bit pricey though.
pos,Was a great experience. Volcano look amassing my Aussie partner first time to see a real volcano  he was impress plus casino next door.
neg,The room was comfortable although the design was a bit old-fashioned. The bathroom was very spacious and clean.
pos,Actually we've here for third time  and it is still an awesome stay we had.
pos,Very nice  with good service and the food was excellent
neg,It was comfortable  clean but provided little or no entertainment. The construction of the skyranch park is right beside so it was abit noisy. Was upset with the staff when they claimed we do not have complimentary breakfasts yet were given coupons for breakfast. the transport back to Manila airport was way too expensive at $3 400 pesos but we had no choice. We were even charged for a phone call to our next hotel when we asked if the staff could check for us.
pos,Enjoyed our stay here. Will recommend highly to friends who are visiting Tagaytay.
pos,Enjoy. Good to recommend to friends.
pos,Excellent comfortable stay with great views. However I found the morning buffet extremely expensive with poor variety and even most of the food was cold. Otherwise the stay was fine
neg,Disappointed by the LakeWing rooms view  which was overlooking a construction site  despite the expected Lake view.
neg,It was a great stay but was not satisfied with my request as it was specified that I requested for a Lake view but was not provided since there was this wedding function that occupied most of their rooms. They should have contacted guests about this as my intention for the stay was for relaxation.
neg,It was a great hotel w fascinating view of Taal Lake  however d AC n our room was not working properly. They didn't offer us to move to other room for our comfort   we paid extra to get an upgrade room to premium.
pos,We came as a group and the staff made accommodations to our various requests  all staff were courteous and willing to help
pos,good  and i want to go back here
pos,If you want a view of Taal Lake and Volcano Island you must pay for an upgraded room. Other wise this is a major international hotel with all the features you would expect.
pos,It was like being treated like a queen :)
pos,Don't be deceived by the lake wing room option. As soon as you arrive  you will be informed that this room whilst being in the lake wing has no view of Taal. I begrudgingly forked out the extra $20 a night to have a view of the lake. The view is beautiful  it's one of the main reasons you go to Tagaytay. The other being it's beautifully cool climate.
neg,The hotel is huge  wasn't able to truly go and see all of it hence you might get lost trying to find the Kid's room or spa or the pool. They have a nice view of taal in their garden and the hotel is just walking distance away from the local casino and the sky ranch park. The bad thing though there is no view on our room. Only on premium rooms do they have views of taal or the mountains  and that costs a lot more.
neg,the hotel was an old building  old finishing  the park beside didn't finish totally. beds blanket not so clean  a lot of bug contain .
pos,very nice place
neg,its a great experience to stay in taal vista but unfortunately the weather wasnt that good strong wind and rains and thick fog over the surroundings.
pos,BBBIIIGGG hotel stretched along lengthwise overlooking the breathtaking Taal crater. Depending on where you're located  walks can be long to get to the pool  for example. But this is minor in a modern  comfortable hotel with a great location. Close by Sky Park if you've an urge to ride a big ferris wheel with another stunning view.
pos,Memorable and relaxing!
pos,I am very impressed on the view and makes me feel closer to the nature
neg,I was a bit dissappointed that i got a smaller room than what i was expected. I booked a lake wing with expectation that i would see the view of the lake but i was goven a room very far view from the lake and aircondioner was warm.
pos,really enjoyed staying at taal vista. romantic for couples. i can recommend taal vista to other friends.
pos,I wanted to stay within tagaytay because it was the nearest vacation spot we could go to at that moment. I have visited taal vista 2 years ago and since then  was interested to stay overnight. It has changed for the better and I would really want to come back. A friend of mine already booked there and I told her it was so worth it.
pos,the best so far...two thumbs up!!!!
neg,We had a great time at the hotel however our bathroom (room 203) stinks which welcomed us upon entering. Tsk tsk!
pos,great location!
pos,We were celebrating our wedding anniversary when we stayed together with our 3 teenage children. We checked in late at around 6 30 pm already and so I asked if we could request for a late check out. The receptionist immediately said yes of course with a smile on her hace. What a nice gesture! Since it was our first time to stay at this hotel we did'nt know all their facilities and amenities and was surprised to find out that they have a nice restaurant called Cafe on the Ridge. Cost of the buffet is reasonable and the ambience was good so we decided not to go out anymore. We enjoyed the music till 12 midnight and it was a memorable one. We will definitely come back and recommend this hotel to our friends.
pos,If you goto Tagatay- you must stay here to fully appreciate your holiday and the Taal Volcano!
pos,It was very pleasant. Very friendly and professional staff. The concierge by the name of Chris was very friendly and most helpful. The hotel is beautiful and very well maintained with large grounds for guests to walk and just hang out and relax. The night time appearance of the hotel was also magnificent. There are close by places to visit within walking distance such as a close by mall  a casino  and even a theme park next to the hotel. Public transport is easily accessible - just outside the hotel. There was also a McDonald's just across the road from the hotel. A very pleasant stay for sure. This is definitely one hotel I would like to stay in again if I should visit Tagaytay again.
pos,We had a great time. Meal servings are good for 2. The location was very nice because in front of it there is a casino and on its left side is a theme park for kids. ;)
pos,Hotel was clean  simple but nicely decorated. breakfast - not much variety. spa was awesome!
pos,What a fabulous stay  Staff was very friendly  room was incredible  spacious and clean. The view outside the balcony was worth the money spent. The lounge and resturant were very satisfactory. Most incredible garden and views of the lake and Volcano. Sunset! Holy Cow! Fast Wi-Fi  comfortable bed and flat screen TV with HBO! Only thing was the walk to our room were kind of far but made up for it when we saw the room. For the price  I will be back soon.
pos,We enjoyed our stay there  The hotel is Just across A CAsino and adjacent to Sky Park where you can enjoy some rides while viewing Taal Volcano. Few meters you can Find lots of Restaurants that you can have a romantic dinner.
pos,We had a great time at Taal Vista Hotel. We upgraded to a crater view room as the lake view wing DOES NOT include a view of the crater lake (a bit deceptive). We had a balcony that overlooked the crater and it was spectacular. I spent each morning just viewing it with my coffee. The staff was friendly with the exception of one lady at the front desk who was very short. Overall the hotel was very nice and I would return.
neg,Buffet breakfast selection is expensive with the kind of food that they serve. Not enough selection but the price per person is too expensive.
pos,the overnight stay that i had with my family at taal vista hotel is very worthwhile. it was my first time to make a reservation via agod.com and i have to say that it's a very good experience. the check-in was short and sweet - upon my arrival  i simply presented the voucher and they started facilitating. since i have with me my passport and i immediately offered a usd deposit  the entire check-in conversation with the hotel rep was quick. we appreciated it much that they gave us rooms with connecting doors and moreso  it was on the ground floor fronting the swimming pool. my nephew and niece was just so happy about it. cleanliness and service was fast. hotel staff were attentive and very friendly. the rooms has been refurbished since my last visit there and i have to say that it looks great now! the AC was working well and the bathroom was spacious too! very happy about our stay!
neg,It's fine but our feet ached because of a long walk from the lobby to our rooms. Since we are attending a wedding  we are wearing our formal wear and heels so the long walk is quite a challenge.
neg,Stay was excellent  Hotel is very good but unfortunatly we got bad room as we imagined it will have mountains view or Taal view but it was not i got very bad under construction view either everything was perfect
pos,It took us more than 30 minutes to get our rooms  during rush hours specially if the hotel has scheduled weddings they should plan to have extra staff to ensure other customers are not impacted. Room was comfortable  probably the menu can have more options considering this is one of the best hotels. I liked the Spa service.
pos,This is my 3rd stay in Taal Vista Lodge and I will definitely be returning. The view of Taal is great. The gardens are large for the kids to run around in. The rooms in the new Lake Wing are spacious and clean. Although the pool is at the other end of the property  there are golf carts to take you there.
pos,Excellent  will come back. Staff is very pleasant and professional.
pos,Great hotel  amazing location overlooking the Taal volcano. We were able to check-in at 9am in the morning which was a pleasant surprise.Tons of nearby restaurant options  which is good because eating at the hotel was a bad experience. We waited for over 1hr for our meals to arrive in the hotel restaurant. Food was average also  except for the lobby dessert bar which was great!
pos,It isnice to stay to this hotel. If you want stress free place i recoomend. But the thing i dnt want  i reserve but i did not get the room wbhich i reserve a month ago.. But still thankful they allow us to checkin early.
pos,"Good hotel, a little old, cold and 30mns from the lake by taxi. But with a breathtaking view! the food is ok and the park is worth seeing. Bon Hotel for 2 or 3 Nights."
neg,we had fun but they should add more parking space they should add security personnel
pos,Excellent  the only disappointment was I tried to extend another night and they were already sold out of the room I was staying in. Would definitely go back!
pos,taal vista is our home in tagaytay. despite the presence of new botique hotels  it has remained very competitive in terms of overall customer experience. the view with wide spaces give you an exhilirating experience. the buffet breakfast and the lunch never fail to satisfy. i just wish the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff both in the restaurants and the rooms are consistent.
neg,view ix nice staff are very acccomodating but the Delux Room small kinda old ..the choices of food at room serviceis minimal n expensive .
pos,The price is reasonable and the room was spacious and clean. The hotel provides a good view of taal lake and volcano and provides easy access to restaurants. The staff is friendly and service is prompt. Activities for children are available. The food is great.
neg,The problem with this hotel is that it has a very poor room service... 1st night i asked for a bucket of ice  2 hours later i followed up but it never come. 2nd night we asked for an extra blanket after 3 hours we called again to follow up and complain why they took so long to give so finally after 30 mins they gave us. 3rd day we ordered carbonara  i asked for salt and it took almost an hour before the guy to give us the salt. (as usual we still need to ff up). We complained to the manager and he acknowledged our complains and did service recovery... otherwise it was a pleasant stay. I just hope that they will improve their service so that they'll be worthy to be called a 5-star hotel.
pos,Really enjoyed our stay at this beautiful hotel. Check in staff upgraded us to a better room. We should have paid to have a room overlooking the magnificent view and will definitely do this next time  as it it definitely worth the extra cost!
neg,"The hotel is good for Filipino standards, but has its best times behind us should be renovated. Everything is still OK, but not more."
neg,Overall we enjoyed our stay. We were a little disappointed about the size of the pool. It looked bigger on the web. We also didn't like there being no robes. Our room was listed as Deluxe Lake Wing  but there was no lake. It was a construction site. I was asked to upgrade for a better view.
pos,Great stay in the hotel where you can have nice view of the entire lake
pos,The location of Taal Vista Hotel gives the best view of Taal Lake. Eco-friendly nature and well maintained garden matched well. We love the climate in Tagaytay  its natural cool air so relaxing. Musical entertainment by singers & band adds romance to the listening guests. Nearby  there are plenty of restaurants serving good  delicious food. Overall  our stay in Taal Vista Lodge is satisfactory.
pos,The hotel has very efficient staff. The best view of Taal Lake and facilities and amenities are world class. I wouldn't recommend it for travelers on a tight budget. Do not go during the lent season  the traffic is really bad.
neg,I specially booked the more expensive lake wing  thinking that this would also mean lake view. But in this I got super disappointed. Arriving at the room  I noticed that just about 3 meters from our window was just another building. Means  not a bit of lake to see from there. The room in general is OK. Big enough  but also not extremely nice for a 5* hotel. Beside the (no) view  the most annoying thing about it was  that there is no door from the room to the bathroom- toilet. By arrival at the room we noticed that there are no bathrobes. We had to follow up twice to get finally one. The front desk manager also told us that I booked this 5* hotel thinking about having a great  romantic weekend with my girlfriend out of Manila. he would try to find another  better room for us. He took my phone number  but never came back with an answer for our request. I was just wondering; for what hes asking if everything ok  if he anyway doesnt do anything about it. Not about the bathrobe and also not about the room. The food in the restaurant is also not on a level of a 5* hotel. And me  as Im a chef  I really know about what Im saying. But just dont get me wrong  Im definitely no one who is complaining easily about everything. But the menu is simple and the dishes are missing every kind of seasoning. At least the view from the garden  where we took our meal in the afternoon  is compensating a lot! You can see the lake and the volcano crater in a really nice atmosphere! Anyway I would suggest you  to have dinner at ANTONIOS restaurant. Its just an amazing location  and the food is also pretty good. And for breakfast or brunch I would go to breakfast @ Antonios  which is much more affordable  but still very good!
pos,We had a wonderful stay. We plan to go back and stay here again the next time we are in Tagaytay.
pos,interesting and memorable-with a good view of the great taal volcano. has housing developments nearby.
pos,hotel was comfortable and presentable. lobby is great and elegant. mother nature is just in the hood.
pos,Had a good 2 night stay for my wedding. The room given was at the new area  the design was modern  zen type. I recommend this place for thos with extra budget. Other hotels in the area  smaller ones  have a more countryside vibe  This hotel is more of a Manila type hotel
pos,We enjoy our stay and we look forward for our next visit. Thanks for the whole staff! GOD bless you all!
pos,Very comfortable stay and a good view of the Taal lake/Volcano. You need not roam around Tagaytay to enjoy your vacation
neg,good  the only thing is our room is facing the construction area by the ferris wheel with on a partial view of Taal Lake (blocked by pile construction materials)
pos,I loved the hotel. It had been a long time since I came and stayed overnight in Tagaytay and I must say I was surprised with the transformation of the hotel... :-)
neg,we were a bit disappointed with the supposed upgrade we got from the hotel. having booked on a weekend  it was expected that it will be packed. the upgrade would have been good but it took us far from the swimming pool. the de luxe rooms given us also has mosquitoes. it was supposed to overlooked the garden area but no garden was in sight. the staff also gave us breakfast tickets but cancelled the same after verifying that we did not book for rooms with breakfast. it was understandable  however  one of our group members (we booked 6 rooms) who did not get an upgrade (but worked to their advantage as they are near the pool) was still given free breakfast.
pos,I enjoyed my stay. The building has high ceilings. The doormen were very welcoming. The servers And food service people were always polite  smiling. I felt very secure inside the building. I was expecting a lake view room but didnot get it.
neg,This was not our first time at Taal Vista. We choose this hotel mainly because of its good location. It's centrally located  and near the good restaurants in Tagaytay (we love to eat!). But this time  we were quite disappointed. The check-in procedure took so long. Guests were required to register first  and made to wait several minutes before being given their room card keys. The registration area looked like an airport queue. I had to follow up twice before being given our room. I don't expect this from a hotel who claims to be five-star. Yes  it's peak season  but they should know how to manage the influx of guests. And we have paid in advance! The worst part was that we paid for a lake-view room and were given a room with a view of a construction site of the nearby amusement park!
neg,Had very bad experience in checking-in. No system at all. Its quite frustrating when no one assisting you after a long drive going tomthe place. There seem to be lack of sensitivity from the reception area. The staff from the restaurant  housekeeping and managers are quite helpful.
neg,Room and cleanliness were okay. Food was not worth the amount paid as the choices were very limited especially the buffet.
pos,It was a great vacation even spent in short time. One thing I love about this hotel is the free wifi every where you go 24 hour open. The crew were very hospitable and attentive. Food was a bit expensive but it was offset ted by the good ambiance staying inside the room and around the hotel premises. Great stay and will definitely be back here again
pos,The hotel rooms are quite nice and spacious  the view is spectacular. Parking space are abundant with basement level for check in guest  security guards are courteous and the staffs are attentive. The only setback is you have to validate your parking ticket at the reception everytime you go out  also a bidet in the bathroom would be nice.
pos,attentive staff  when we complained about the air conditioned unit  they immediately attend to our needs. we had a great holy week family vacation! :)
neg,My stay was good. Clean and comfortable room. However  the room and dcor was dated and old looking. The wing that we stayed in was the older part of the hotel and it needs updating.
neg,As expected since it was peak season being a holiday  the hotel was fully booked. There was nothing spectacular about the room we were assigned to. I felt that with the rate I paid for it should have included breakfast. We checked in at around 4pm since it was super traffic going up to Tagaytay via Sta Rosa that day. The hotel front desk said our room was upgraded bec the room I reserved was given to someone else but I need not pay for the difference. The room was ok...no view just a garden of cement and some plants in a pitiful effort to make it look like a garden.
pos,We love the quiet surroundings. We felt truly refreshed and energized after our stay. We would be coming back for sure.
neg,It was a nice place except I wasn't too happy with the room. It had a funny old room smell  maybe they need to renovate. Staff was very friendly and accommodating.
pos,It was a very relaxing experienced. I'll probably come back to this hotel.
pos,The hotel was a five star! Very well maintaned and child friendly facilities. With free welcomed drinks
pos,we had a great time staying at taal vista hotel bec. of good food  nice view overlooking the taal volcano  nice weather  and a relaxing atmosphere inside the hotel.
pos,We had a wonderful stay; the hotel has everything a traveler needs: aside from the usual amenities of television  airconditioning and mini-ref  they provide coffee-makers and free coffee  which very few hotels do. It takes a big burden off the guests  who don't have to walk all the way to the hotel's restaurant everytime we want to have coffee. the position of our room was perfect  even though we were not facing the Taal volcano  we were right beside the swimming pool so it was very  very convenient if any of us or our children wanted to swim  it would be so easy to keep an eye on them. Best of all was the free wi-fi! This is what matters most to our family as everyone is always on the internet and people become miserable when there is no access or when the fee is so exorbitant like in most hotels where we stayed in the U.S. Also a great feature is the casino right in front of the hotel.
pos,It may be a 45-minute car ride to the lake and the volcano (the reason why most visitors come to Tagaytay) but this is a luxury hotel to be pampered in and feel spoiled. The service is perhaps a bit on the slow side (OK - very slow)  but the lobby bar was a great place to listen to music and chill out in the evenings with generous helpings of bar food at reasonable prices. The 'happy hour' is worth remembering! All in all  not the cheapest hotel but worth the money to feel a bit special for a few days!
pos,We checked into this hotel for our 1st night as married couple. The room we got was so spacious and very clean. We are very picky when it comes to bathrooms and this one has a squeaky clean restroom with a nice theme. We will surely go back to this hotel soon for an R&R in the Tagaytay area.
pos,over stay was good but needs heater on the pool when temperature drops to a cold climate. staff are accomodating
pos,View of taal volcano and the lake is excellent. Hotel is well maintained despite its age. Room is big  clean  and with quiet. Staff anywhere in the wide hotel area readily extends help and w/ a smile always. Our kid enjoyed the pool with its clean and fresh water without the chlorine.
pos,THE PLACE WAS QUITE AND SUITABLE FOR HONEYMOONERS.WE enjoyed the pool even it's too cold during our stay there. It's well maintained hotel and daily housekeeping were done but we're just surprised that we're not informed during the housekeeping in the morning  that the person can access inside our room and change every linen or towel without our knowledge.luckily our things were all intact. if you're craving for mcdonalds restaurant  it is walking distance so u can take-out and bring in to the hotel.
pos,Our stay at the hotel was a pleasant experience. We like that the room is clean and the staff were very efficient.
pos,enjoyed our stay with the kids. we were able to unwind.
pos,It was a pleasant stay  the housekeeping is very helpful and fast response to the guest request. Check-in  and check-out transaction need to be improved  and make it faster. The swimming pool is a bit small. It will be good to have an in-door heated pool especially since the location is very cold.
pos,Wonderful hotel and nice location with a best services.
pos,Generally comfortable stay. Hot water was so cool that taking a shower with only hot water was the only option. One morning I was sleeping a little late and the maid came to the door to ask if she could make up the room. My companion told her to come back later. Shortly after that I was awakened by a phone call asking if they could make up the room. This is not what I consider to be good service.
pos,It was cold at the time and so we did not use the aircon and it was still ok. The buffet breakfats is something for us to look forward to. However  our suggestion is to have yogurt in the buffet as well as other local delicacies. over-all  our stay was good thanks.
neg,We stayed at Taal Vista for our post valentines day celebration. We both came from meetings so just imagine how excited we are to just relax. I got to Tagaytay earlier than the check in time so what i did was to register and just wait for the room to be available. When i registered  their receptionist Julian swiped my credit card for the 2000 peso deposit. We finally went back to the hotel at 6pm and was told they do not have my registration on file. They were even asking us to pay another deposit. The room was a so so and so was the buffet breakfast. When we were about to check out  they were going to charge us for another night had i not check the charge slip. It was really a nightmare staying at this hotel. The other small hotels we stayed at did not have flashy uniforms for their staff bur they really banked on good training and efficient service. Our stay was a total disappointment and it definitely ruined the weekend for us.
pos,taal vista has the best view of taal lake and taal volcano among the hotels in tagaytay. the staff were very helpful. the rooms are clean and spacious. the hotel is easy to locate as it is along the main road. if you dont have a car it is rather difficult to go around because there are no taxicabs in this beautiful city.if you want to gamble  the casino is just across the street. there is also a mcdonalds in front of the hotel. i will go back to this hotel and recommend it to my friends and relatives.
pos,Room was clean  staff were accommodating  check-in/check-out was quick
pos,We planned on spending our Valentine's day in Taal Vista Hotel because we were told this is the best place to stay in Tagaytay. True enough  our stay was short but sweet. However  none of the foods we ordered matched to our expectations. Except for the coffee  the salad  cakes  beef steak  fried chicken need a lot of improvement in the taste department. We are going back again for sure  but will more likely eat out. Thanks for the wonderful time.
pos,It was a great stay with my family. The only thing is the transport  the tricycle driver asked too much fare. So next time just wait for the jeepney if you wanted to go to the mall or bus. But overall it was a great stay in this hotel especially their pool. Might come back next time.
pos,It is a nice hotel to stay and a great view of Taal Volcano. We might consider coming back to this hotel again.
pos,Ample sized rooms  clean and we'll maintained. Hotel service was great. Food was awesome. This is really one of the best place to spend the holidays in Tagaytay.
pos,We were there for a friend's wedding. Service is ok although it was long holiday that week. Our baby was very comfortable walking around the hotel. Nice decors too since its nearing Christmas.
neg,Reserved room w/ view of taal volcano(partial) but was given room w/ view of a construction. You were better off leaving the drapes closed than looking a dirt view. An ugly and dirty view plus a dirty room just does not give you that aura that you are on vacay. My friends and I are traveling from the U.S. and there is no way we were going to settle for this. We were offered the upgrade for an adfitional fee right from the check-in but declined. We thought our reservations were already in the pricier room category. We definetly felt like we were set-up to upgrade.
pos,Our family liked this hotel. It is quite near Taal volcano and all the other hang-out places in Tagaytay. The lunch buffet is average. The Tagalog dishes are superb but bacon  everyone's favorite is not that crunchy. Important: Make sure to book the Premier Lake Room and enjoy the beautiful view of Taal Volcano and lake 24/7! At night  the air feels so wonderful. It's the best ambiance for wine or games/ bonding with the family. However  the downside is that the room service is a bit slow and needs follow up for simple requests like extra bottle of water.
neg,My stay in this hotel could have been perfect if not for the very poor service at the check in counter. The front desk staff seems inadequate to attend to good number of guest. I suggest that the hotel should consider beefing up their front desk during weekends and holidays as they should anticipate more guests than normal day. The front desk also  even if you book double occupancy  do not automatically give 2 sets of room keys. You still need to request this.
