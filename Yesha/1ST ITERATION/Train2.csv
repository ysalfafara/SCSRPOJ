neg,We stayed in the mounting wing for our first night. The room had a nice view. But the room in this wing seemed outdated compared to the Lake wing rooms. Sadly  the shower drain we had in our room wasn't working properly. It was flooding every time we had to use the shower. We had requested to change rooms for our second night. Also  there was an on-going construction in the mountain wing but they weren't noisy or too obstructive.;
pos,The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view  we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view  of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall  it was a  good comfortable stay.;

pos,The view to the lake was amazing! Great Breakfast Buffet! Kids friendly. Sky Ranch with nice rides for kids of all ages & a zip line etc is walking distance from the hotel (right next to Taal Vista)!

neg," Expected the room to have a view of the lake but apparently, the name Lake Wing was misleading. I had to upgrade to a room that actually had a view of the lake!"
pos,Breakfast is wonderful. The resort has a great viewing deck where you see a breathtaking panoramic view of the Taal lake and volcano.
neg,"There is no hot water in the bathroom. Maybe we should have requested to switch another room but since we only stayed there for one night, we just didn't hustle for the change"
neg,It was a full comfy experience excess for the food service at the lobby & as well in the taza restaurant. The service was too slow & we need to keep on calling the waiter for follow up. The was also a time wherein they forgot to serve 1 order which got my mom frustratedz
neg,"The pool is quite far away if your room is in the lake wing, and the signs to get there are not very clear - in fact, there aren't many around! I happened to cross paths with the manager of Taal Vista Hotel who was very accommodating and helpful as he also pointed out the kids club room - but that too needs improvement as there weren't many things to play with at the time my kids were there"
neg,"this hotel is overrated. for a price of 8500 it's not worth it. it's old. the hallway looks creepy and smells like a hospital, you have to walk very far to reach your room. if price range was around 4000 then, it would be a great deal for money."
pos,I booked the room for my sister celebrating their wedding anniversary. The staff sent them a cake with a greeting which was a very nice gesture.
pos,Staff was super friendly & helpful. Location is perfect.
neg,"The food was not good. I think it is overpriced. I asked for extra bed, charged me 1800 including brkfast but I woke up at 3am bec I was cold. The blanket with the extra bed too thin so I asked for an extra blanket. Noisy people on the upper floor & room beside us."
pos,"I was satisfied with my mom & dad''s room 265, overlooking taal lake??... The view has surprised my dad on his special day????"
neg,No bidet in the bathroom
neg,"Some of the furniture (sofa, bath tub) were a bit dated. Not much vegetarian food options in the breakfast buffet."
pos,"The location was excellent, near reataurants, it had the best view of the lake. I had a very relaxing bath with the hot water and bathtub. Service was excellent."
neg,"Bed was hard for my liking. During breakfast, there was a wide variety of food on the buffet but was disappointed bec food that's supposed to be hot was cold. No brown sugar or splenda alternative for coffee"
neg,I cant extend my stay. I little bit expensive though it's worth the stay.
neg,No night swimming
pos,"We liked the food, all staff were friendly and the room is clean."
neg,The washroom - it's not clean. The bath tub and the floor is dirty.
pos,"Celebrated my birthday here in Taal Vista and it's one of the most memorable! :-) they prepared something for me in my room and gave all the request we asked, the best staff I've seen in a hotel! Will book this hotel for my wedding for sure."
pos,Immense improved faculties since the old Taal Vista Lodge
neg,My visitors at lake view side stayed at premier rooms on the third floor. We went the circuitous way when in fact there is a shorter route via 2nd floor lift. There should be a written instruction to guests regarding this info
neg,No assistance from the staff taking you to your designated room
pos,"Stunning location overlooking the volcano and lake, very good buffets, nice large comfortable rooms, friendly staff. Loved Tagaytay, weather is much cooler than Manila"
pos,"the buffet breakfast was good. our deluxe room is very comfy. an additional single bed was provided without a fee,its definitely a plus for a fa,ily of 2 adults and 2 kids.thank you Taal Vista."
neg,There's no bidet in bathrooms.
neg,They should give the rooms a revamp. The floortiles in our room were loose... Breakfast was plenty but mediocre.
neg,the checkin was a bit slow. but its ok we were greeted warmly and with drinks.
pos,"The place was just perfect & what we needed for a relaxing overnight stay. It was raining the day we checked in, but we had a wonderful sleep, thanks to the in-room massage we had! The weather got better the following day so I woke up to the beautiful site of the Taal Lake and its surroundings. It was just breath-taking! There was a variety of choices for breakfast, and I was even able to request for hot choco! Yum! The walk around the hotel grounds was relaxing and nice, and the shop inside the hotel was convenient (I forgot to bring a shirt, but got one there.). The front desk ladies were pleasant, and all the hotel staff were polite and friendly wherever you meet them. It was a great experience overall! Would stay again! :)"
pos,"I like the most are the staffs, they are very courteous and respond to our queries immediately. It offers good & tasty breakfast. Also, it has a great view of Taal Lake. The hotel is huge, very clean and their check-in and check-out services is fast."
neg,Toilet bowl had water stain ring
neg,Poor coordination.
neg,They didn't accommodate my request prior to my stay from Sunday to Wednesday.
neg,Woke up sweating at 4am bacause of defective airconditioning only to be transfered to another non-cooling aircon room. 2 room transfers in 1 day 
neg,i think its a bit xpensive for 9500 per night since we do not even have balcony and bathtub in our room.
neg,"Coffee was cold. Called the customer/room service literally 6 times! Nothing happened! Our request didn't arrived. So we decided to personally go to the lobby and ask. Wasted 2 1/2 hours waiting for nothing. We were supposed to surprise our mom coz it was her birthday, because of this, surprise was ruined. Very disappointing ...??????????"
neg,"Upon check in, the staff is ignorant about senior citizen discount. ..we persisted and eventually got it."
pos,"The location was great. We stayed here for a friend's wedding in the area. Rooms in the Lake Wing are newer and better. And the rooms with the lake view are great. We transferred to a Lake wing room on the second night. Although we did not get the lake view, we were lucky that the room we got had a nice view of the nearby park and a glimpse of the lake. Overall, it was a good comfortable stay."
pos,"We enjoyed ourselves during our stay. The view is magnificent. Our room is so-so. It can be dusted a little more like the top of the pictures, lamp shade, bathroom amenity tray, etc. My husband and I are a bit more critical than most guest being he was in the hospitality business for decades. The bathroom is ok. The grounds are clean and have a dedicated area for smokers. Parking is available for a fee unless it's validated. Our room was #464 which only has a courtyard view. We'd stay there again."
neg,Not enough restaurants within walking distance. Hotel taxi to airport or bus station not free.
neg,Wifi is weak
neg,Poor explanation regarding pre-authorization payments.
pos,"The hotel is beautifully situated for the best views of the phenomenal vistas of the craters and lakes so iconic of Tagaytay. The restaurants serve great drinks, snacks and sandwiches though we did not eat a meal in the hotel. We stayed in a lovely large suite in the older wing of the hotel. The ensuite bathrooms are small and a little dated but the rooms are comfortable and the beds are great. The spa at the hotel was excellent as well. "
neg,Room was dated. Bed was uncomfortable.
pos,"We stayed at the Lake Wing and we had a nice view of the Taal Lake and the SkyRanch from our veranda. The rooms were big, clean, spacious. The view from the veranda was very relaxing and we enjoyed it so much. The hotel is PWD friendly. The staff were helpful. The restaurant serves good breakfast although not many choices. Overall, we had a very relaxing and enjoyable family bonding at this Hotel."
neg,The service at the coffee shop at night when my wife and I stayed there to order drinks.
pos,"It was an awesome trip for us since one of us came from Mindanao (Me and my other friend from Cebu) and we just met in Manila for that short vacay. Good decision we moved here from our initial booking at The Lake Hotel since the latter was under renovation during our travel. Taas Vista was easy to find and staff were accommodating. We only stayed a few minutes at the lobby to complete the check in process. Reaching our room, while my friends took a rest after our long travel, I stayed at the terrace as the view was alluring. From there, you will have the best sight of the lake and like 45 degree view of the Sky Ranch. In terms of food, they offer a variety for breakfast at their buffet stations."
pos,"we stayed in the lake wing of the hotel. we originally booked a deluxe room but got an upgrade upon check in. the room was clean, bathroom was spacious, and the view of Taal lake from the veranda was very relaxing. staff were very courteous and helpful."
neg,The room didn't have bathtub and the room looks outdated. We stated at the lake view room with balcony. 
pos,Very good breakfast
